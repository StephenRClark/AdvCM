    "text": "6.1 Rank-2 tensors\nIn the last lecture we expanded our repertoire of geometrical objects by constructing one-forms as linear functionals of 4-vectors. Given one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) we obtain a Lorentz scalar \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\). The duality of this construction means that we could eqaually view 4-vectors as linear functionals of one-forms, so we get the same Lorentz scalar as \\(\\vec{A}(\\tilde{Q})\\). We can write this more symmetrically as \\(\\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{A} \\rangle\\). Pictorially we can view these two objects as:\nUsing the basis \\(\\vec{e}_\\mu\\) spanning the vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) of 4-vectors we have the expansion \\[\n    \\vec{A} = A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu.\n\\] The 4-vector basis then generates a biorthonormal basis of one-forms \\(\\tilde{e}^\\mu\\) obeying \\(\\langle \\tilde{e}^\\mu, \\vec{e}_\\nu \\rangle = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\), from which one-forms are expanded as \\[\n    \\tilde{Q} = Q_\\mu\\tilde{e}^\\mu.\n\\] The contraction is then \\(\\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{A} \\rangle = Q_\\mu A^\\mu\\).\nIn this lecture we will generalise this construction to more general objects called tensors. Indeed 4-vectors and one-forms are tensors. Specifically, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\textrm{4-vector} &\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right)~{\\rm tensor},\\\\\n     \\textrm{one-form} &\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)~{\\rm tensor},\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] where the notation \\(({M \\atop N})\\) denotes a tensor with \\(M\\) upper 4-vector-like indices, or alternatively an object that ‘eats’ \\(M\\) one-forms, and \\(N\\) lower one-form-like indices, or eats \\(N\\) 4-vectors. We will denote a general tensor as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\). The next simplest tensor is rank-2 with 2 indices, for example a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor which is a linear functional on two 4-vectors \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\vec{A}\\in\\mathcal{M},\\vec{B}\\in\\mathcal{M} \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nJust as with 4-vectors and one-forms we can full determine the action of this linear object by acting it on basis 4-vectors for each of the vector spaces \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) it acts on as \\[\n    T_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\vec{e}_\\beta).\n\\] As expected for a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor its components have two lower indices. To complete the circle, how can these components reconstruct the geometrical object \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\)? They correspond to how much tensor product basis of one-forms \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\) contribute to \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\). Notice how \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\) is a type \\(({0 \\atop 1})\\) tensor, as is \\(\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\), hence \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\) is an elementary type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor. The components \\(T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\) then reconstruct the tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\,\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta.\n\\] If we now act \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on two 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) we can explicitly compute this as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) &= \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu,B^\\nu\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\textrm{expand 4-vectors}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\tilde{e}^\\alpha(A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu)\\tilde{e}^\\beta(B^\\nu\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad \\textrm{expand tensor}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\mu B^\\nu\\tilde{e}^\\alpha(\\vec{e}_\\mu)\\tilde{e}^\\beta(\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad \\textrm{linearity of one-forms}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\mu B^\\nu\\delta^\\alpha_\\mu\\delta^\\beta_\\nu, \\qquad\\qquad\\quad~~ \\textrm{biorthonormality}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\alpha B^\\beta.\n\\end{align}\n\\] The final answer is a proper contraction of lower and upper indices which tells us that \\(T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\alpha B^\\beta\\) is a Lorentz scalar according to our index rules. This is reassuring since \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B})\\) is a geometrical quantity based on abstract objects with no reference to any particular reference frame.\nSo how do the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) transform between inertial frames? Since it has two lower indices we can guess immediately that it must be \\[\n    T_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^\\alpha_\\bar{\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_\\bar{\\nu}T_{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\tag{6.1}\\] You are now invited to show that if this is true it guarantees that \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B})\\) is a Lorentz scalar.\nThe analogous reasoning applies to a type \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\) tensor which is a linear functional on two one-forms \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\tilde{Q}\\in\\mathcal{M}^*,\\tilde{P}\\in\\mathcal{M}^* \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nIts components are found by acting it on basis one-forms for each of the vector spaces \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) it acts on as \\[\n    T^{\\alpha\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha,\\tilde{e}^\\beta),\n\\] which then reconstruct it as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = T^{\\alpha\\beta}\\,\\vec{e}_\\alpha\\otimes\\vec{e}_\\beta.\n\\] Acting \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on two one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\) then gives \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P}) = T^{\\alpha\\beta}Q_\\alpha P_\\beta,\n\\] and this is a Lorentz scalar since the tensor components transform as \\[\n    T^{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\alpha\\Lambda^{\\bar{\\nu}}_\\beta T^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\] This leaves the final possible rank 2 tensor of type \\(({1 \\atop 1})\\) tensor which is a linear functional of one one-form and one 4-vector \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\tilde{Q}\\in\\mathcal{M}^*,\\tilde{P}\\in\\mathcal{M}^* \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nIt is a matter of convention opting to list the one-form first and the 4-vector second. The components of a type \\(({1 \\atop 1})\\) tensor are found by acting it on a basis one-form in \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and basis 4-vector in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) as \\[\n    {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha,\\vec{e}_\\beta).\n\\] An immediate question is why we don’t write the components as \\(T^\\alpha_{\\beta}\\) or \\(T^{~~\\alpha}_{\\beta}\\). In this current context there is no ambiguity about what the indices refer to so any of these forms can be used. However, issues can arise when we start manipulating indices as we will discuss shortly.\nWe can reconstruct the tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta}\\,\\vec{e}_\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta,\n\\] and acting \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on a one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and a 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) then gives \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\vec{A}) = {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta}Q_\\alpha A^\\beta.\n\\] This is a Lorentz scalar since the tensor components transform as \\[\n    {T^{\\bar{\\mu}}}_{\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\alpha\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar{\\nu}} {T^\\alpha}_\\beta.\n\\] Having fully specified rank 2 tensors we should now consider an example of one crucial to special relativity.",

    "text": "6.2 The metric tensor\nWe have already encountered a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\)-tensor in Scalar-product and one-forms in the form of the scalar-product which endows our vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) with concepts of length and orhtogonality. As a nod the general relativity course next year, we will denote the abstract geometrical tensor as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\). Formally this tensor is defined as one taking two input 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) and returns their scalar-product as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) = g_{\\mu\\nu}A^\\mu B^\\nu = \\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B}.\n\\] From this expression we can immediately identify its components as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\mu,\\vec{e}_\\nu) = g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] as being equal to the Minkowski metric described in Introducing 4-vectors.  Consequently, the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) transform as \\[\n    g_{\\bar\\mu\\bar\\nu} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar\\nu} g_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar\\nu} \\eta_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\eta_{\\bar\\mu\\bar\\nu},\n\\] and hence in flat space-time the metric has identical elements equal to the \\(\\eta\\) symbol in all inertial frames, as we saw in Scalar-product and one-forms. Since the scalar-product is symmetric so is the metric tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{B},\\vec{A}) \\implies g_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\nu\\mu}.\n\\] The inverse metric tensor, denoted \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\), is a \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\)-type tensor defined to take two input one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\) and return their scalar-product \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P}) = g^{\\mu\\nu}Q_\\mu P_\\nu = \\tilde{Q}\\cdot\\tilde{P}.\n\\] Hence it is also symmetric with elements \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{e}_\\mu,\\tilde{e}_\\nu) = g^{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] The metric and its inverse have identical components in every inertial frame. The reason we denote \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) as the inverse of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is that their components obey \\[\n    g^{\\mu\\alpha}g_{\\alpha\\nu} = g_{\\nu\\alpha}g^{\\alpha\\mu} = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu,\n\\] which converted into a matrix expressions give \\[\n    \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\mu\\alpha}[\\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\alpha\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\mu\\nu} = \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\nu\\alpha}[\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\alpha\\mu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\nu\\mu}.\n\\] However, we know that both \\(\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\) and \\(\\underline{\\underline g} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\), while \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}^{\\rm T} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}^{-1}\\), and so \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\, \\underline{\\underline \\eta} = \\mathbb{1}\\) hence \\[\n    [\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\mu\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\nu\\mu} = [\\mathbb{1}]_{\\mu\\nu},\n\\] as required for an inverse. This property is crucial for a key use of the metric we now introduce.In this course we will always assume space-time is flat so \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) always has components \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\). However, in general relativity the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) are functions of space-time which deviate from \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and whose behaviour encodes the curvature of the space-time.",

    "text": "6.3 Raising and lowering indices\nArmed with the metric tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) and its inverse \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) we can convert 4-vectors into one-forms and vice versa. Suppose we took a 4-vector \\(\\vec{V}\\) and inserted it into the first slot of the metric as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\cdot)\\), but left the second slot free. Since \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is symmetric it doesn’t matter which slot we filled or left empty. What remains is a linear object which eats a 4-vector and returns a scalar, or in otherwords a one-form \\[\n    \\tilde{V} = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\cdot).\n\\] We have used the metric to make one-form version of \\(\\vec{V}\\). The components of this object follows as \\[\n    \\tilde{V}(\\vec{e}_\\mu) = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\vec{e}_\\mu) = V^\\nu\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\nu,\\vec{e}_\\mu) = V^\\nu\\eta_{\\nu\\mu} = V_\\mu.\n\\] Notationally we say we have lowered the index of \\(V^\\nu\\) to \\(V_\\mu\\) by using the metric.

Manipulating the metric tensor\nSolution …\n\n\n\nUsing the metric and its inverse to raise and lower indices is more than just an algebraic trick. Indeed one could envisage using any symmetric invertible type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor \\(h_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and its inverse \\(h^{\\mu\\nu}\\) type \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\) tensor to define index raising and lowering. Formally all the above definitions could be applied with \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{h}}\\) instead. However, the Lorentz scalars resulting from contractions with \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{h}}\\) have no obvious physical meaning or significance. In contrast \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is central to the geometrical structure of space-time defining the scalar-product, so distances, time and angles, as well as its causal properties such as the light-cone and geodesics. As we shall see in the next lecture physical quantities of intrinsic interest arise from the scalar-product. So \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is not just a invertible rank-2 tensor, it is a unique and privileged one with both geometrical and physical meaning. In the context of a flat space-time in special relativity we also have the added bonus that \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) and \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) have the same fixed components in all inertial frames making index lowering and raising extremely straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a basis 4-vector to a one-form\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the basis 4-vectors and one-forms are related to each other through the biorthonormality relation \\[\n    \\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\nu) = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu.\n\\] So one might ask what one-form is generated by converting a basis 4-vector using the metric? We get \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\cdot) = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\alpha)\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\nu = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^\\mu_\\alpha\\tilde{e}_\\nu = \\eta_{\\alpha\\nu}\\tilde{e}^\\nu.\n\\] The one-form \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\cdot)\\) is not simply \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\). Even with the simple flat space-time metric considered in this course there can be a sign difference, e.g. \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_1,\\cdot) = -\\tilde{e}^1\\). In general relativity, where the metric can be non-diagonal, these two one-forms are completely different.",

    "text": "6.4 Higher rank tensors\nAll our earlier work on rank-2 tensors can be readily generalised to higher ranks ones, specifically rank-\\(M+N\\) tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) of type \\(({M \\atop N})\\). This object takes \\(M\\) input one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P},\\dots,\\tilde{R}\\) and \\(N\\) input 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\dots,\\vec{C}\\) and maps them all to a scalar \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P},\\dots,\\tilde{R},\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\dots,\\vec{C}) \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}\n\\] as depicted in this figure:\n\n\n\nA rank-\\(M+N\\) tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) of type \\(({M \\atop N})\\) takes \\(M\\) input of one one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P},\\dots,\\tilde{R}\\) and \\(N\\) 4-vector \\(\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\dots,\\vec{C}\\) and maps them all to a scalar \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P},\\dots,\\tilde{R},\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\dots,\\vec{C})\\).\n\n\nAs before we extract its components by acting it on an appropriate number of basis one-forms and 4-vectors as \\[\n    {T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha,\\tilde{e}^\\beta,\\dots,\\tilde{e}^\\gamma,\\vec{e}_\\mu,\\vec{e}_\\nu,\\dots,\\vec{e}_\\sigma).\n\\tag{6.2}\\] These components transform between frames \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar S\\) as \\[\n    {T^{\\bar{\\omega}\\bar{\\chi}\\cdots\\bar{\\theta}}}_{\\bar{\\rho}\\bar{\\lambda}\\cdots\\bar{\\kappa}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\omega}_\\alpha\\Lambda^{\\bar \\chi}_\\beta\\cdots\\Lambda^{\\bar \\theta}_\\gamma\\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\rho}\\Lambda^{\\nu}_{\\bar \\lambda}\\cdots\\Lambda^{\\sigma}_{\\bar \\kappa}\\,{T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma}.\n\\] Indeed, any object whose components transform between frames like this is a type \\(({M \\atop N})\\) tensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to write tensor indices\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth remarking on the notation used in Equation 6.2. Specifically, why can’t we just write the indices more compactly as \\[\n   {T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma} \\stackrel{?}{\\equiv} T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma}.  \n\\] The short answer is that you can, but you should be careful. As shown in figure above, the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) is taken to be acting on a tensor product of the \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The ordering matters since it indicates which of these spaces is being acted on. The compact form ensures that we can still identify the ordering of all upper and lower indices between themselves, but does not track the ordering between upper and lower indices. For the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) this is fine since upper and lower indices correspond to distinct types of vectors spaces making it unambigious what is meant.\nThe situation where care must be taken is when indices are lowered and raised thus inchanging upper and lower indices. Take the example of a type \\(({2 \\atop 1})\\) tensor with components \\(T^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\gamma\\) written compactly. The index \\(\\alpha\\) can be lowered as \\[\n    T^{\\beta}_{\\gamma\\mu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\alpha}T^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\gamma,\n\\] whereupon we need to make a choice about where to put the new lower index. Above we have used a convention of placing any new upper or lower index at the back. Now suppose we raise the \\(\\mu\\) index back up as \\[\n    T^{\\beta\\alpha}_{\\gamma} = \\eta^{\\alpha\\mu}T^{\\beta}_{\\gamma\\mu}.\n\\] Now the ordering of the upper indices is reversed. This is not a fatal problem but it could be potentially confusing.\nA way around this is to retain the full ordering of the tensor product by stacking upper and lower indices separately. Now no convention is required when lowering or raising and the ordering of indices is always unambiguous, e.g. \\[\n    {{T_{\\mu}}^{\\beta}}_{\\gamma} = \\eta_{\\mu\\alpha}{T^{\\alpha\\beta}}_\\gamma,\n\\] meaning the raising of the \\(\\mu\\) index recovers the original tensor \\[\n    {T^{\\alpha\\beta}}_{\\gamma} = \\eta^{\\alpha\\mu}{{T_{\\mu}}^{\\beta}}_{\\gamma}.\n\\] For clarity we will always use this full ordering of indices, but you may well see the more compact version in textbooks.",

    "text": "6.5 Physics is tensorial\nWe should remind ourselves why we have developed the formalism of tensors. Back in first lecture Principle of relativity we stated is that the laws of physics should not depend on what coordinate system or reference frame we choose to describe them in. Tensors are precisely the mathematical objects whose components transform in such a way that the relations between them remain invariant under any smooth change of coordinates. We can therefore make our principle of relativity from earlier more precise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of relativity (refined version)\n\n\n\nThe laws of physics should have a tensorial form because physical phenomena are geometric and coordinate-independent.\n\n\nThis means that we should construct or identify physical quantities in our theories as Lorentz scalars, 4-vectors, one-forms and tensors. Typically we may construct a tensor from other objects like \\[\n    {\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}} = n\\,\\vec{U}\\otimes\\vec{U} + p\\,\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1},\n\\] where \\(n,p\\) are Lorentz scalars, \\(\\vec{U}\\) is a 4-vector and \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) is the inverse metric.  Often Lorentz scalars formed from the contraction these quantities, say like \\[\n    \\tilde{K}(\\vec{X}) \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad \\vec{P}\\cdot\\vec{X} \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad {\\pmb{\\symbb{W}}}(\\tilde{K},\\vec{P},\\vec{X}),\n\\] will play a central role, as we will see in the next lecture.In fact the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) here is the stress-energy tensor for dust which we will discuss briefly in a later lecture\nWhile it is essential that all these quantities are geometrical in practise when doing calculations we will work with an explicit representation in terms of components of some inertial frame, so we have \\[\n    K_\\mu X^\\mu \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}P^\\mu X^\\nu \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad {W^\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} K_\\mu P^\\alpha X^\\beta.\n\\] We can use the index formulation for all quantities, along with the appropriate rules for contraction and transformations, safe in the knowledge that we are faithfully describing the underlying abstract geometrical objects of the theory. For this reason we will have little use for the basis 4-vectors \\(\\vec{e}_\\mu\\) and one-forms \\(\\tilde{e}^\\nu\\) or explicit tensor product \\(\\otimes\\) from this point on, but will appreciate they are hiding behind the scenes of our working.\nEnd of Lecture 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The Quotient Rule for testing tensorality\nWe will now look at a useful trick for proving an object is a tensor.\n\nAssume we have a set of quantities \\(a_\\mu\\), such that the inner product with every 4-vector \\(v^\\mu\\) gives a Lorentz scalar. Prove that \\(a_\\mu\\) must transform like the components of a one-form.\nAssume that the inner product of a set of quantities \\(b^\\mu\\) with every one-form \\(u_\\mu\\) gives a Lorentz scalar. Prove that bμ must transform like the components of a 4-vector.\n\nThis trick can be extended to test tensorality. Suppose we have some putative multi-index object \\({Y^{\\mu\\nu}}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\). This is a tensor if a Lorentz scalar is obtained when it is contracted it with a suitable number of arbitrary 4-vectors and one-forms. Can you think why it is called the quotient rule?\n8.

    "text": "It feels like we have come a long way since the first lecture about special relativity. Let’s try to summarise the main steps we have made, before looking at how these ideas get generalized in further theories.\n\nOverview\nIn Part I, we considered how to write down expressions that are Lorentz invariant (for scalars), or covariant, taking on the same form in all inertial reference frames, following the principle of relativity, namely that all inertial frames should be equivalent for the formulation of physical laws. Following the invariance of the spacetime interval between two events, we developed our notion of 4-vectors and one-forms, whose components keep track of minus signs, based on the Minkowski metric \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}.\\) We recognised that relativistic energy and momentum are related as the 4-momentum \\(P^{\\mu},\\) and that fields are continuous functions of spacetime, such as 4-velocity fields and 4-currents. The 4-momentum flux of a matter field is given by the symmetric, rank 2 stress energy tensor \\(T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\mathrm{matter}}.\\)\nIn Part II, we saw that the Lagrangian \\(L\\) for a classical mechanical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom can be generalized to continuously many degrees of freedom, via a Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L},\\) whose Euler-Lagrange equation is a PDE, involving space and time derivatives on an equal footing. In fact, if \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a Lorentz scalar, the Euler-Lagrange equation, on varying invariant or covariant field quantities, is itself relativistically covariant, automatically giving covariant field equations. This involves the divergence theorem in four dimensional spacetime, and the full solution of a problem requires specifying boundary conditions on a four-dimensional spacetime volume \\(\\Omega.\\)\nThe d’Alembert equation (with wave speed \\(c\\)) is the simplest relativistic wave equation, and this in principle can be solved using Fourier methods with appropriate boundary conditions, and we identify the Fourier representation as a relativistic plane wave superposition. More complicated Lagrangians involve source terms (leading to inhomogeneous field equations), or higher-than-quadratic field combinations (leading to nonlinear equations).\nWe realized that conservation laws for fields correspond to finding 4-currents which are divergenceless, and proved Noether’s theorem which finds such currents based on symmetry of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) under some continuous symmetry of ‘field space’. Separately, in the problems class, we saw that a similar argument makes the stress-energy tensor divergenceless when the field sees, through its Lagrangian, Minkowski spacetime as homogeneous.\nIn Part III, we saw how Maxwell’s equations could be put into a covariant form by realizing the components of \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) are components of the rank 2 antisymmetric Faraday tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu},\\) and that there are two relativistic Maxwell equations. \\(V\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) are naturally components of the 4-potential \\(A^{\\mu},\\) and electromagnetism can naturally be put into the Lagrangian framework if the varied field is the 4-potential itself. However, we do not have a full, fundamental Lagrangian approach to electrodynamics without a field theory for matter, which motivated us to consider relativistic quantum mechanics.\nIn Part IV, we saw that a way of constructing quantum mechanical matter field equations was to equate the action of the energy operator on a (relativistic) wavefunction with a relativistic expression for the energy in terms of the momentum operator acting on the wavefunction. We also noticed that the continuity of probability density is a conservation law related to the noetherian symmetry of global gauge (phase) invariance of the wavefunction, and, when the quantum particle is charged, interactions with the electromagnetic field imply that gauge transformations of the electromagnetic potentials are related to a local gauge symmetry on the wavefunction.\nWe first considered the Klein-Gordon equation, which is like the d’Alembert equation with an extra term proportional to the particle’s Compton wavenumber squared times the wavefunction. Although the KG equation has many desirable features for a relativistic quantum wave equation, we rejected it due to its being second order in time (so we cannot propagate it only knowing the initial wavefunction), and that the current arising from gauge transformations has a possibly negative density where we would expect to see a nonnegative probability density.\nThis led to us to consider Dirac’s approach of a multicomponent wavefunction, which in turn led to the definition of the Dirac equation in both Hamiltonian and relativistically covariant forms. Gauge transformations of the Dirac equation (involving the 4-component Dirac spinor \\(\\psi\\) and its adjoint \\(\\overline{\\psi}\\)) indeed now lead to a divergenceless 4-current whose 0-component is now positive definite. We saw how Dirac proposed to resolve the paradox of negative energy states (which have their own plane wave solutions) with the idea of a ‘sea’ of filled negative energy states; now we interpret these negative energy states as related to antimatter (although we have not discussed how). When interactions are included, the Dirac equation, in the nonrelativistic limit, becomes the Pauli equation, and we concluded by writing down a Lagrangian which encompasses charged matter and the electromagnetic field, coupled by an interaction term, based on the Lorentz force Lagrangian involving the electromagnetic 4-potential and the Dirac 4-current.\nWe now outline how many of these concepts generalize and are utilized in further fundamental theories of contemporary physics.\n\n\nFurther Special Relativity\nThe linear relativistic field equations we derived and discussed in the course can be put into the table below, depending on whether they include a mass or are massless, and according to their spin (i.e. the number of independent field components), ignoring interactions.\n\n\n\nspin\nmassless equation\nmassive equation\n\n\n\n\n0\nd’Alembert equation\nKlein-Gordon equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\square^2\\varphi = 0\\)\n\\(\\square^2\\varphi + \\left(\\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 \\varphi = 0\\)\n\n\n1/2\nmassless Dirac (‘neutrino’/Weyl) equation\nDirac equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu} \\psi = 0\\)\n\\(\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu} \\psi + {\\rm i} \\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar} \\psi = 0\\)\n\n\n1\nMaxwell equation (homogeneous)\nHomogeneous Proca equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_{\\mu} F^{\\mu\\nu} = 0\\)\n\\(\\partial_{\\mu} F^{\\mu\\nu} + \\left(\\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 A^{\\nu} = 0\\)\n\n\n3/2\nmassless Rarita-Schwinger equation\nmassive Rarita-Schwinger equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\gamma_{\\nu} \\partial_{\\rho} \\psi_{\\sigma} + \\gamma_{\\rho} \\partial_{\\sigma} \\psi_{\\nu} + \\gamma_{\\sigma} \\partial_{\\nu} \\psi_{\\rho} = 0\\)\n\\(\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\gamma^5 \\gamma_{\\nu} \\partial_{\\rho} \\psi_{\\sigma} + \\tfrac{m c}{2\\hbar}[\\gamma^{\\mu},\\gamma^{\\nu}] \\psi_{\\nu} = 0\\)\n\n\n\nIn fact, if we were to continue, we would see the (empty space) Einstein equation for general relativity in the massless spin 2 slot, and the inhomogeneous form as the full Einstein field equation. Feynman, in the Feynman Lectures on Gravitation, shows how it is in principle possible to build up a classical field theory using symmetry arguments to show the relevant field is a massless, traceless symmetric rank 2 tensor (i.e. spin 2), and then forcing the resulting Lagrangian to be gauge invariant; the connection with the curvature of space is only made after the field equations are written down.\nIn fact, these field equations follow from the mathematical structure of the Poincaré group of all Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Using the representation theory of this group as matrices, Bargmann and Wigner (Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 34 (1948) 211-23) showed that each of the group’s ‘irreducible representations’ are labelled by a continuous parameter (the mass \\(m\\)) and a discrete parameter (the spin), and there is a unique relativistic wave equation for each pair. For massive particles in their rest frame, the spin is equivalent to that of a nonrelativistic particle, and there are the same number of independent components. For massless ‘particles’ with null 4-momentum, however, the set of relevant Lorentz transformations keeping the state fixed is equivalent to the 2-dimensional euclidean group (i.e. 2D rotations and translations), which leads to the restriction to only two spin states, parallel and antiparallel to the corresponding null vector: this accounts for why plane waves corresponding to massless fields (EM, gravity) are transverse to their direction of propagation.\nOne encounters particular difficulties in trying to derive a sensible physical interpretation from solutions of equations for massive particles when the spin gets high, beginning with the Rarita-Schwinger equation (introduced in Phys Rev 60 (1941) 61). As argued by Velo and Zwanziger (Phys Rev 186 (1969) 1137-41; 188 (1969) 2218-22), the wavefronts of a charged RS field, and other massive spin \\(&gt; 1\\) fields, can propagate faster than \\(c,\\) in conflict with usual notions of causality. Thus matter fields appear to be mainly made up of Klein-Gordon, Proca and Dirac fields; in fact, the only fundamental massive particles in the standard model with spin 0 are Higgs bosons.… It turns out that other fundamental interactions, beyond EM and gravity, can be explained using multicomponent generalizations of the gauge transformation relationship between the EM potential and the phase of a wavefunction: the corresponding classical wave equations are nonlinear, ‘nonabelian’ (i.e. matrix-valued) Yang-Mills theories, as discussed below.\n\n\nGeneral Relativity\nEinstein’s original motivation for General Relativity was to widen the class of frames in which the formulation of physics is equivalent. Rather than only consider inertial frames, we now describe all frames of reference on spacetime – ‘general covariance’. Geometrically, this is equivalent to considering arbitrary curvilinear coordinates on spacetime, and the class of allowed transformations is widened to include any coordinate system. Each generalized frame/coordinate system is specified by a metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu},\\) which is now a tensor with respect to all coordinate transformations. In particular, \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is now typically a function of position (representing the changing nature of the coordinates), and the coordinate axes are typically oblique, leading to a more complicated relationship between covariant and contravariant tensor components under the new class of transformations.\nWith this more general setup, physics can allow a description where the spacetime manifold itself might be curved (and therefore cannot not admit globally defined inertial frames). On a local scale, however, spacetime is assumed to be Minkowski: in a small neighbourhood of a spacetime event, a frame which looks locally inertial can always be found. Care is needed to have a tensorial notion of derivatives in this general setting (since derivatives \\(\\partial_{\\mu}\\) depend on the geometry of the frame of reference); covariant derivatives \\(\\nabla_{\\mu}\\) are properly tensorial, and defined as the usual spacetime derivatives in each event’s local inertial frame. Formally, the covariant derivative is defined \\[\\nabla_{\\mu} C^{\\nu} = \\partial_{\\mu} C^{\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\mu \\rho} C^{\\rho},\\quad \\nabla_{\\mu} C_{\\nu} = \\partial_{\\mu} C_{\\nu} - \\Gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu \\nu} C_{\\rho}.\\] The \\(\\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\mu \\rho}\\) are called Christoffel symbols or connection coefficients, and they are not themselves tensors; they can be found as coordinate derivatives of the metric tensor.\nThe covariant derivative bears some similarity to the gauge covariant derivative for a quantum matter field coupled to the EM field, although they are fundamentally different (and cannot be easily combined, leading to some of the difficulties in describing charged matter fields in GR). In particular, covariant derivatives do not commute, \\[[\\nabla_{\\mu},\\nabla_{\\nu}]C^{\\sigma} = R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu} C^{\\rho},\\] where \\(R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu}\\) is the Riemann curvature tensor, which is a rank 4 tensor expressing the curvature of spacetime. As a form of generalized curl, it satisfies a Bianchi identity \\[\\nabla_{\\tau} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu} + \\nabla_{\\mu} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\nu\\tau} + \\nabla_{\\nu} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\tau\\mu} = 0,\\] as well as several symmetries between its indices, leading to 20 independent components.\nThe contraction \\(R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\mu\\sigma\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) defines the symmetric Ricci tensor with 10 independent components, in turn whose contraction \\(R^{\\mu}_{\\phantom{\\mu}\\mu} \\equiv R\\) gives the curvature scalar. Einstein defined a curvature tensor \\(G^{\\mu\\nu} = R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu} R\\) which is divergence-free, and the Einstein field equations are \\[G^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T^{\\mu\\nu},\\] whose source term is the total stress-energy tensor of all energy-momentum (matter, EM fields, ...). This equation is nonlinear, and hence very difficult to solve in general.\nIn general relativity, gravity appears as a form of ‘fictitious force’ arising from choice of a non-inertial coordinate system. Other phenomena should be described in usual tensorial form, albeit with covariant derivatives; in GR, Maxwell’s equations are written \\[\\nabla_{\\mu} F_{\\nu\\rho} + \\nabla_{\\nu} F_{\\rho\\mu} + \\nabla_{\\rho} F_{\\mu\\nu} = 0, \\qquad \\nabla_{\\mu}F^{\\mu \\nu} = \\mu_0 J^{\\nu}.\\]\nGeneral Relativity can also be cast in a Lagrangian form, as originally suggested by Hilbert. The corresponding ‘Einstein-Hilbert action’ has a strikingly simple form: \\[\\mathcal{S} = \\int (C R + \\mathcal{L}) \\sqrt{-g}{\\rm d}^4 x,\\] where \\(C\\) is a constant, \\(R\\) is the curvature scalar, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is the Lagrangian density for matter and EM fields, and \\(g\\) is the determinant of the metric tensor at each point. (In special relativity, we could ignore \\(\\sqrt{-g}\\) because the determinant of the Minkowski metric is always \\(-1.\\)) The Euler-Lagrange equations, on varying the metric tensor, give the correct Einstein field equations.\n\n\nQuantum Field Theory\nQuantum field theory is a natural extension of this course: our approach to quantum matter fields did not include multiple quantum particles, which can only be described when ‘fields are quantized’. This procedure is rooted in the fact that our relativistic field equations (with mass—and hence \\(\\hbar\\)—or otherwise) are all classical PDEs, expressing equations of motion for field variables continuous over space and time.\nIn a fixed Lorentz frame, one can find wave fields oscillating at a fixed frequency \\(\\omega\\) with time dependence \\(\\cos \\omega t.\\) Quantizing the field consists of quantizing this as a ‘classical harmonic oscillator’ (even if it is a quantum wave), giving, for each frequency \\(\\omega,\\) quantized energy (frequency) eigenstates \\(\\hbar \\omega (n+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\) with a corresponding ‘occupation number’ \\(n.\\) The ladder nature of the quantum harmonic oscillator spectrum implies going up (or down) by \\(N\\) steps requires \\(N\\) ‘quanta’ of \\(\\hbar \\omega,\\) and for the EM field, these ‘quantized field vibrations’ are photons!\nThis procedure is sometimes called ‘second quantization’: we already had one Hilbert space describing the modes of the field, and now to each Fourier frequency \\(\\omega\\), we associate an extra harmonic oscillator Hilbert space! The quantized field excitations must satisfy the correct particle statistics on exchange (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac), and thus fermion field modes can only have an occupation number of 0 or 1. The quantization of free fields is straightforward, but not necessarily informative. Interactions must also be built in, and how this complicates matters is easier perhaps to see in the ‘Lagrangian approach’ to second quantization, rather than the Hamiltonian ‘canonical field quantization’ above.\nThe ‘Lagrangian approach’ is based on the path integral approach to quantum mechanics, where quantum probability amplitudes relating initial and final states are found by the sum \\(\\sum_{\\mathrm{all\\,paths}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rm i}{\\hbar}\\mathcal{S}\\right).\\) The paths consist of all possible sequences of values, over all times, that the degrees of freedom the corresponding classical Lagrangian \\(L\\) may take, and this approach is completely dual to the usual Hamiltonian picture of Hilbert spaces, operators, etc. The classical equations of motion arise in the semiclassical limit, as the exponentials in the path sum oscillate very rapidly apart from when \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) does not change much when the path is varied, i.e. when the Euler-Lagrange equations are satisfied.\nNow, classical fields have an action too, but rather than sum over all paths, we now take a functional integral over all spacetime field configurations which satisfy our given boundary conditions on our chosen spacetime volume \\(\\Omega.\\) Once again, the classical field equations arise when the action is stationary with respect to field variations, but now, there are always small fluctuations around, which are usually interpreted as particle-antiparticle pairs appearing in the vacuum (which also enters the canonical quantization picture from the ‘zero point energy’ \\(\\hbar \\omega/2\\) for each frequency).\nFor ‘Quantum Electrodynamics’, the action is that corresponding to \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{QED}}\\) as derived in the lectures. The free Dirac term, and the EM field term, are complicated but calculable, as the Lagrangian is quadratic in those terms, so the functional integral can be treated as a generalized Gaussian. However, the interactions, involving a cubic product of \\(\\psi, \\overline{\\psi}\\) and \\(A_{\\mu},\\) cannot be evaluated analytically. Nevertheless, since the coupling constant is small—it can be taken to be the dimensionless fine structure constant \\(\\alpha = q^2/2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar c \\approx 1/137\\)—the cubic term in the Lagrangian in the exponential can be Taylor expanded within the functional integral. The resulting series (with gaussians in the free field Lagrangians) can be interpreted combinatorially via ‘Feynman diagrams’, made up of ‘interaction vertices’, each one originating from the cubic interaction term in the full QED Lagrangian.\nThis theory has many mathematical problems which physicists have learned to get around or reinterpret, and all calculations are based on evaluating perturbation series. Nevertheless, precise experiments agree extremely well with quantum electrodynamic predictions, and the theory arises directly on generalizing classical relativistic field theory.\n\n\nGauge Theories\nThe great success of QED inspired the quest to find alternative quantum field theories to describe the other two fundamental forces, the weak and strong nuclear forces, again starting with Lagrangian field theories. Given that protons and neutrons have very similar properties apart from charge, Heisenberg suggested that they were in fact two orthogonal ‘isospin’ states of some 2-spinor in the internal field space of a ‘nucleon’ particle. That is, instead of being independent Dirac particles, they are two components of an ‘isospin doublet’ \\((p,n),\\) and the corresponding Lagrangian should be invariant to \\(2\\times 2\\) unitary transformations of this 2-spinor, by analogy with the usual Lagrangian of a quantum wave being invariant to transformations of the complex phase.\nHowever, it is not immediately obvious what sorts of fields/potentials arise from such nonabelian (i.e. noncommuting) gauge transformations of multicomponent fields. Yang and Mills (Phys Rev 96 (1954) 191-5) observed that, since all \\(N \\times N\\) unitary transformations can be represented by \\(U = \\exp\\left({\\rm i} \\sum_k \\tau^k \\ell_{k}\\right),\\) that is as exponentials of sets of generators \\(\\ell_k\\) (which are hermitian \\(N \\times N\\) matrices), nonabelian Yang-Mills potentials can be defined \\(A^k_{\\mu} \\ell_{k}\\) (with the summation convention on \\(k\\)). These potential matrices couple to matter via generalizations of the gauge covariant derivative, and give rise to (nonlinear, nonabelian) ‘fields’ similar to the Faraday tensor.\nThe original attempts to describe the strong nuclear force with \\(2\\times 2\\) unitary matrices failed. However, in the 1960s, Gell-Mann showed that a generalization based on \\(3\\times 3\\) unitary transformations could describe the strong nuclear force in terms of quarks and colour interactions, and in the 1970s, Salam, Weinberg and Glashow showed that the weak force can be understood from an SU(2) \\(\\times\\) U(1) ‘broken symmetry’ from a larger invariance combined with electromagnetism, the ‘electroweak force’.\nAlthough all of these further theories require generalizations, including curved spaces, operator-valued fields or matrix-valued potentials, they are rooted firmly in the language of relativistic field theory. I hope that your knowledge from this course of relativistically covariant fields, Lorentz invariant Lagrangians, Noetherian symmetries, etc, should help you in the future in trying to understand these fundamental theories of the universe!",
