    "text": "Unfortunately, there is no single book that covers the material we will be discussing, in an appropriate level of detail. However, you can expect to find a lot of the material in books on ‘quantum field theory’, in an earlier chapters called something like ‘classical fields’. Where possible, I have put the books in the short loan collection of the library. I believe all of the material in the course can be found somewhere in one of the books below; section of the library has other relevant books, and of course there are many online materials too. You will also find extra topics and further development of the material in the recommended books, which I hope will demonstrate the universality of the material we are discussing. I would be particularly interested to know if you find other books not in this list relevant and useful.\n\nElectrodynamics of Classical Fields and Particles A O Barut\nStrongly recommended treatment which covers the material of this course at a similar level, although in a different order to us. Particularly good is the treatment of special relativity in Chapters I and II, relevant to Part I of the course.\nIntroduction to Elementary Particles David Griffiths\nA very good particle physics book that covers relevant relativistic field theory very well, albeit in a different order to us. There is also an online version of the book available from the library website. Chapter 3 is relevant to Part I, Section 7.4 to Part III, Sections 7.1-7.3 and 11.2-3 to Part IV.\nClassical Electrodynamics John David Jackson\nThe ‘classic’ book on the theory of electromagnetism and electrodynamics. Useful for background on Maxwell’s equations and solutions of them. Material for Part III of this course is in Chapters 6, 11 and 12. The most recent third edition uses SI units throughout, as we do; previous editions use other systems of units.\nQuantum Field Theory: A Modern Introduction Michio Kaku\nOne of several books on ‘Quantum Field Theory’ (which is beyond the scope of our course), that gives a quick review of Relativistic Field Theory. The book mainly is aiming towards an understanding of particle physics. Sections 1.7-1.9 of the book are particularly recommended for Part II of the course, Section 4.1 for Part III, and some of Chapter 3 and Section 4.2 for Part IV.\nThe Classical Theory of Fields L D Landau & E M Lifshitz\nVolume 2 of the classic ‘Course of Theoretical Physics’, required reading for Soviet Theoretical Physics students. Chapters 1 and 2 are relevant to Part I of the course, and Chapters 3 and 4 to Part III. Relativistic fields are studied in detail, but with less emphasis than we take on the lagrangian approach. Landau and Lifshitz Volume 1 on Classical Mechanics may also be useful.\nThe Principle of Relativity: A collection of original memoirs on the special and general theory of relativity H A Lorentz, A Einstein, etc in Queen’s Library.\nA collection of (translations of) the original papers by Lorentz on Lorentz transformations, Einstein’s papers on Special and General Relativity, and Minkowski’s on Minkowski space. Everybody should at least have a look at these groundbreaking and accessible papers, which are particularly relevant for Part I of the course.\nIt’s about time: Understanding Einstein’s Relativity N David Mermin\nA gentle introduction and discussion of the basics of special relativity. Although we will go much further in this course, the book is very well written and strongly recommended for more of an insight and background into special relativity.\nThe Road to Reality Roger Penrose in Arts and Social Sciences Library.\nA very good book to find out what one of the great minds of contemporary science thinks about physics and mathematics. Unfortunately, he leaves actually deriving most of the equations as exercises. Particularly useful in seeing how advanced mathematical topics (such as differential geometry) are related to physical concepts. You will find sections relevant to all parts of the course in this book, and I recommend persevering with it if you are thinking about further study in theoretical physics.\nClassical Field Theory Davison E Soper\nGood treatment of the non-quantum aspects (although with the opposite sign for the Minkowski metric), which follows the ordering of our lectures. Chapter 1 is good for Part I, Chapters 2-3, Section 9.1 for Part II, and Chapter 3 for Part IV.\nThe Theoretical Minimum Leonard Susskind & George Hrabovsky\nA very basic introduction to the lagrangian aspects of the course, starting from a completely elementary level and finishing at electrodynamics, although for our purposes it is better for background than specific detail. One of the co-authors is widely renowned for his contributions to string theory and the holographic principle.\n\nBe warned that many of these books follow different conventions from us, so it is always worth checking (usually in the Preface or first chapter) what the chosen sign of the Minkowski metric is, whether the time index is 0 or 4, the notion for various types of partial derivative for fields, the types of units (and whether \\(c, \\hbar, ...\\) are set to 1), etc. I would be interested if you find particular conventions I have chosen for the course inconvenient when referring to these books.",

    "text": "In this course, we will discuss one of the most basic, fundamental theories in modern physics: the combination of special relativity and fields. A field, of course, is a function \\(f(t,x,y,z)\\) (which may be a scalar, vector, or some other object) which satisfies some differential field equation, such as a wave equation. Examples of fields include electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, the velocity of fluids, and quantum wavefunctions (which are complex-valued, and may have several spin components).\nSpecial relativity, to the best of our knowledge, is a fundamental principle of the universe: at least locally, all inertial frames are equivalent for formulating physical laws, and any theory of physics that is not special relativistic is an approximation (relevant at low velocities, or only in one frame of reference). This suggests that if a certain field is fundamental, its field equation should somehow be compatible with special relativity. It turns out that the time-dependent wave equation (d’Alembert equation) and Maxwell’s equations are compatible with relativity, but Schrödinger’s equation, Newton’s law of gravity, the heat diffusion equation, ... are not.\nThe main purpose of this course is to understand the formulation of field theory in relativistic terms, and then look the most important examples of relativistic fields. In classical physics, these relativistic fields are time-dependent scalar waves and the electromagnetic field. In quantum physics, they are relativistic generalizations of the Schrödinger equation: the Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation.\nThe course consists of 38 videos covering four major topics:\n\nSpecial Relativity and Lorentz Covariance The mathematical language of relativity, via invariance of Minkowski metric under Lorentz Transformations. Tensors, contravariant and covariant indices.\nLagrangian Field Theory Generalization of Lagrangians from mechanics to fields. Time-dependent wave equation. Symmetries and conservation laws.\nRelativistic Electrodynamics Maxwell’s equations, EM fields, potentials, charges and currents formulated in a way explicitly compatible with special relativity.\nRelativistic Quantum Mechanics General considerations of bringing together SR and QM, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.\n\nEach pair of videos has some “work-along exercises\" associated to it. These questions will explore the concepts introduced in the corresponding videos by asking you to verifying mathematical statements and solve some ‘fridge logic’ problems using the ideas covered. They are designed to assist your progress, so I strongly recommend attempting them as you do the course – or at least read through the solutions.\nAdditionally, there are 4 problem sheets, one for each topic of the course. These questions are more extended and will serve as a useful revision tool later.\nThere are also 3 problems classes. These cover extended examples of concepts important in their own right, and should be considered part of the core course material.\nBy the end of the course, your understanding of relativistic fields should help prepare you to understand other fundamental areas of modern physics: General Relativity (which constructs a ‘classical field’ for gravity by generalizing the symmetries of special relativity), Quantum Field Theory, where relativistic fields are ‘quantized’ (i.e. the fields become operators acting on a Hilbert space, describing systems with multiple fermions and bosons), and Gauge Theory, where the idea of interactions between different systems (such as electrons and electromagnetic fields) are determined by fundamental symmetries of the quantum wavefunction. The latter two ideas are crucial to the proper understanding of particle physics and condensed matter physics. In quantum field theory, one ‘second quantizes’ the wavefunctions, and this procedure is analogous for the Dirac equation (describing quantum-mechanical electrons) and Maxwell’s equations (which then describe photons). For this reason, many physicists would refer to this course as Classical Field Theory, even though some of the fields we consider are from quantum mechanics!\nThis course is assessed 100% by a final written examination. This will take place in June 2023 and is planned to be a conventional closed-note exam. The exam is 2 hours long. The format of the exam is identical to previous years (the last 3 years of past paper are available on Blackboard site along with the feedback forms which give insight into solutions):\n\nSection A (20%) will be 10 multiple choice questions based on conceptual understanding and mathematical manipulations.\nSection B (40%) will be 4 straightforward questions based directly on material from the lectures and problem sheets.\nSection C (40%) will be 1 longer question, going into more detail on previously unseen problems, requiring analysis using your knowledge and techniques developed in the course.\n\nIn addition to the course videos (and pdfs), there are an extensive set of handwritten lecture notes available on Blackboard. The videos follow these notes very closely, so you will find them a useful and complete collection of everything you need to know.\nAny problems or questions, please email me (stephen.clark@bristol.ac.uk) or see me in my office (3.55).",

    "text": "1.1 The setting\nOne of the most basic purposes of physics is to model events, that is points in space and time. We do this by assigning spatial coordinates \\(x,y,z\\) with respect to some Cartesian coordinate system and a time \\(t\\) according to some clock we possess. In doing this we have constructed a reference frame for our observations, as depicted here:\nLet’s consider two such reference frames \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\) moving at a constant speed relative to each other. We will assume \\(S\\) is an inertial frame. It is always possible for an observer to establish whether they are inertial by examining if objects they observe appear to be subject to additional fictious forces (like the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force, and the Euler force). If present this indicates that their frame is accelerating and hence non-inertial. In this course we will be exclusively concerned with inertial frames, however for those going on to do General Relativity you will be dealing with non-inertial frames.\nFor any event \\(P\\) we have two different space-time coordinates: \\[ (t,x,y,z) \\in S,\\] \\[ (\\bar{t},\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z}) \\in \\bar{S}.\\]\nFor simplicity we will consider the standard configuration of these frames where their axes are aligned with each other and their origins coincide at time \\(t=\\bar{t}=0\\), as depicted here:\nWe will assume \\(\\bar{S}\\) is moving at a speed \\(v\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis, so \\(y = \\bar{y}\\) and \\(z = \\bar{z}\\) at all times. At some later time \\(t&gt;0\\) the two frames will be arranged like this:\nThis principle is telling us that there is nothing special about or privileged about any particular inertial frame. The “mathematical form” of a theory are the equations of motion of its constituents (fields and/or particles). The quantities and coordinates involved in those equations can be different between frames, but the mathematical relationship between them is the same. In this case we say a theory is relativistically covariant. Some physical quantities may turn out to be relativistically invariant, meaning their value is identical in all inertial frames.",

    "section": "1.3 Theories of relativity",
    "text": "1.3 Theories of relativity\nAny theory of relativity should provide us with a means of finding transforming the coordinates of a point in space-time between frames. Specifically, we expect that the coordinates in \\(\\bar{S}\\) are functions of those in \\(S\\) as:\n\\[\\bar{x} = \\bar{x}(t,x), \\quad \\bar{t} = \\bar{t}(t,x)\\]\nWhat can we say about these functions in general? These functions should be linear in both \\(x\\) and \\(t\\). Recall that a linear function of two variables \\(f(p,q)\\) obeys additivity:\n\\[f(p+a,q+b) = f(p,q) + f(a,b).\\]\nand homogeneity:\n\\[f(\\alpha p,\\alpha q) = \\alpha f(p,q),\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is a scalar. Requiring linearity follows from the assumption that space-time is homogeneous. This means that space-time is the same at every point, so the spatial distance between two space-time points in one frame should not depend on their location in space-time.A nonlinear transformation between frames, where distances between points varies as a function of its location would inevitably make uniform motion in one frame appear to be non-uniform in another. Hence homogeneity is essential for all inertial observers to agree on uniform motion.\nTake two points \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis in \\(S\\) separated by a length \\(L\\):\n\n\n\nTwo points \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis in \\(S\\) separated by a distance \\(L\\).\n\n\nThe space-time coordinates of these points in \\(S\\) are:\n\\[M \\rightarrow \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t_M\\\\\n  x_M  \n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad N \\rightarrow \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t_M\\\\\n  x_M+L  \n\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nUsing the transformation functions the coordinates of these points in \\(\\bar{S}\\) are:\n\\[M \\rightarrow \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}_M\\\\\n  \\bar{x}_M  \n\\end{array}\\right) =\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}(t_M,x_M)\\\\\n  \\bar{x}(t_M,x_M)  \n\\end{array}\\right),\\]\nand\n\\[N \\rightarrow \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}_N\\\\\n  \\bar{x}_N  \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}(t_M,x_M+L) \\\\\n  \\bar{x}(t_M,x_M+L)  \n\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nNow consider the spatial separation \\(\\bar{L}\\) of the two points in \\(\\bar{S}\\):\n\n\n\nTwo points \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) in \\(\\bar{S}\\) will in general not occur at the same time, but the length between them is still the difference in their spatial coordinates.\n\n\nIt follows that \\(\\bar{L}\\) is\n\\[\\bar{L} = \\bar{x}(t_M,x_M+L) - \\bar{x}(t_M,x_M).\\]\nBut linearity means that \\(\\bar{x}(t_M,x_M+L) = \\bar{x}(t_M,x_M) + \\bar{x}(0,L)\\), hence\n\\[\\bar{L} = \\bar{x}(0,L),\\]\nwhich, crucially, is independent on \\(x_M\\) and \\(t_M\\). Only linearity can guarantee this. With it, irrespective of where the pair of points are located along the \\(x\\)-axis in \\(S\\), their spatial separation in \\(\\bar{S}\\) remains the same. We will see in a later lecture that the spatial separation \\(\\bar{L}\\) in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) has a different value from \\(L\\) in frame \\(S\\). Indeed, the two points \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are no longer simultaneous.\nBeing linear means that the relation between coordinates in \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\) can be expressed as matrix \\(\\mathbf{T}\\):\n\\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}\\\\\n  \\bar{x}  \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n  At + Bx \\\\\n  Ct + Dx\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  A & B \\\\\n  C & D\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t\\\\\n  x  \n\\end{array}\\right) = {\\mathbf{T}} \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t\\\\\n  x  \n\\end{array}\\right),\\]\nwhere \\(A,B,C\\) and \\(D\\) are coefficients which we expect to be functions of the only other parameter, \\(v\\), of the problem. Technically, our coordinates can be related by a linear map \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and a space-time translation (meaning the origins of \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\) do not coincide). Together these give a so-called affine transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming functions between frames\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to frequently encounter situations where we need to transform a function of space and time, like \\(f(\\boldsymbol{r},t)\\), between reference frames. Formally this begins by specifying how coordinates in frame \\(S\\) are related to those in another frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) via some transformation matrix \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) as\n\\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\bar{t} \\\\\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}}\n\\end{array}\n\\right) = {\\mathbf{T}} \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nt \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{r}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\\]\nNext we fix the function \\(\\bar{f}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}},\\bar{t})\\) in \\(\\bar{S}\\) by stating that the transformed function evaluated at the transformed coordinate must equal \\(f(\\boldsymbol{r},t)\\) in \\(S\\), i.e. the untransformed function at the untransformed coordinates. The reason for this is that we are not changing the function, we are just changing our coordinate system, and however we do this we should get the same answer for the same point in space-time. This is depicted here:\n\n\n\nA contour plot of some function in 2D space and two different cartesian coordinate axes (one \\(B\\) rotated relative to the other \\(A\\)) in which to describe points in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane.\n\n\nBy writing the space-time arguments of the function as a vector we have \\[f(\\boldsymbol{r},t) = f\\left({\\mathbf{T}}^{-1}\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\bar{t} \\\\\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\right) = \\bar{f}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}},\\bar{t}).\\] This makes it clear that \\(\\bar{f}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}},\\bar{t})\\) is the function arising when \\(f(\\boldsymbol{r},t)\\) has its space-time arguments inverse-transformed into frame \\(\\bar{S}\\). We will denote this as \\(\\bar{f}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{r}},\\bar{t})\\), with the extra \\(\\bar{\\cdot}\\) on the \\(f\\), to make it explicitly clear this is not just \\(f(\\boldsymbol{r},t)\\) with its variables renamed. The transformation \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) could be a Galilean boost \\(\\mathbf{\\Gamma}(v)\\) or a Lorentz boost \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}(v)\\).",

This theory is based on the common sense assertion that time is universal to all observers, so \\(t = \\bar{t}\\). In other words all observers agree when events are simultaneous. The implications of this are revealed by considering the transformation of the point \\(P\\) from earlier:\n\\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}_P\\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  A & B \\\\\n  C & D\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t_P\\\\\n  vt_P  \n\\end{array}\n\\right) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  (A+vB)t_P \\\\\n  (C+vD)t_P\n\\end{array}\\right).\\]\nFixing \\(t_P = \\bar{t}_P\\) the above relations imply that \\(B = (1-A)/v\\), and \\(C = -vD\\).

This change in the mathematical form of our description does not present any particular issues for the case of a string. After all we know that the wave equation for a string is derived from Newton’s 2nd law, e.g. applied to a chain of coupled masses and then taking the continuum limit. We have shown already that these laws are Galilean covariant between frames. That derivation assumes the string is stationary in the \\(x\\)-direction.

Use vector calculus to show that if we take the electric field as travelling along the \\(x\\)-axis and polarised along the \\(y\\)-axis as \\({\\boldsymbol{E}} = E(t,x){\\boldsymbol{e}}_y\\) then it obeys the simple wave equation in Equation 1.4.

In the standard setup we will further assume that:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial\\bar{x}}{\\partial x} = D(v) &gt; 0, \\quad {\\rm and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial\\bar{t}}{\\partial t} = A(v) &gt; 0,\n\\]\nmeaning that the \\(x\\) and \\(\\bar{x}\\) axes and the \\(t\\) and \\(\\bar{t}\\) axes are aligned and increase in the same direction.\nLet’s consider again the two points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) introduced in the last lecture Principle of relativity for the spatial origin of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) and \\(S\\), respectively. We know what the coordinates of these points are in both frame so by inserting the general form of the transformation we can further constrain them, just like we did for Galilean relativity. Take \\(P\\) first: \\[P \\rightarrow \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}_P\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\n\\right) = {\\bf T}(v)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t_P\\\\\n  vt_P  \n\\end{array}\n\\right),\\] so \\[ \\bar{t}_P = A(v)t_P + B(v)vt_P, \\] \\[ 0 = C(v)t_P + D(v)vt_P.\\] Since \\(t_P \\neq 0\\) we conclude from the second equation that \\(C(v) = -vD(v)\\).

We will denote \\(\\gamma(v) = A(v) = D(v)\\), and so we know that \\(\\gamma(v) &gt; 0\\).\nUsing the behaviour of the spatial origins in both frames we have thus established a general form for the transformation \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{t}\\\\\n  \\bar{x}  \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  \\gamma(v) & B(v) \\\\\n  -v\\gamma(v) & \\gamma(v)\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  t\\\\\n  x  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Assuming the universality of simultaneity, as discussed in the last lecture Principle of relativity, we are forced to take \\(\\gamma(v) = 1\\) and \\(B(v) = 0\\) and arrive at the Galilean transformation \\({\\bf \\Gamma}(v)\\).

This states that there are no privileged directions, so all directions are equivalent. In particular for 1+1D it means travelling along the positive direction of the \\(x\\) axis is no different to travelling along the negative direction. To explore this let’s introduce another frame \\(S'\\) which is moving \\(-v\\) relative to \\(S\\).

Hence \\(t'_Q = \\bar{t}_Q\\), so we see that \\(\\gamma(v) = \\gamma(-v)\\).\nThe transform from frame \\(S\\) to \\(\\bar{S}\\) is \\({\\bf \\Lambda}(v)\\), yet transforming back must be \\({\\bf \\Lambda}(-v)\\) since \\(S\\) is moving with \\(-v\\) relative to \\(\\bar{S}\\).

Lines parallel to this observer’s \\(x\\)-axis are lines of simultaneity, i.e. they connect all events which this observer measures as happening at the same time.\n\n\n\nWhen viewed in frame \\(S\\) the \\(c\\bar{t}\\) axis of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) makes an angle \\(\\theta = {\\rm tan}^{-1}(\\beta)\\), plotted on the right, from the \\(ct\\) axis of frame \\(S\\), as shown on the left.\n\n\nThe world-line of point \\(P\\), the spatial origin of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\), makes an angle \\(\\theta = {\\rm tan}^{-1}(\\beta)\\) with the \\(ct\\)-axis. This world-line is parallel with the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\).\nA crucial question is where does the \\(\\bar{x}\\)-axis lie on this space-time diagram in frame \\(S\\)? In Galilean relativity \\(ct = c\\bar{t}\\) so \\(x\\) and \\(\\bar{x}\\) are parallel. This is not the case in special relativity. By symmetry, one can guess the \\(\\bar{x}\\)-axis will be an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the \\(x\\)-axis. We can confirm this by picking three equally spaced points along the \\(\\bar{x}\\)-axis in \\(\\bar{S}\\) at \\(\\bar{t}=0\\), the spatial origin \\(P\\), \\(K\\) and \\(J\\). Next we shoot light rays from \\(P\\) and \\(J\\) towards the middle point \\(K\\). These meet at a space-time point \\(R\\) on the world-line of \\(K\\). This situation in \\(\\bar{S}\\) is shown here:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nNow we transform this set of points into frame \\(S\\). The world-line of \\(P\\) is the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis we determined above. The world-lines of \\(K\\) and \\(J\\) are parallel to the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis and will still be equally spaced (although their separation will be different - see shortly). Next, we locate \\(R\\) as the intersection of the world-line of \\(K\\) with a light ray from \\(P\\). Then we project a light ray from \\(R\\) backwards and where it intersects the world-line of \\(J\\) is the event \\(J\\) itself. Finally, we draw a line through \\(P\\) and \\(J\\), its intersection with the world-line of \\(K\\) is the point \\(K\\) itself. This line is the \\(\\bar{x}\\) axis and is an angle \\(\\theta\\), as expected, from the \\(x\\)-axis in frame \\(S\\).",

    "text": "3.3 Space-time interval\nLet’s consider the point \\(P\\) with coordinates \\((ct_P, x_P)\\) in \\(S\\) and ask what is its distance from the origin \\(O\\)? The value for the distance should be computable by some recipe from the coordinates in some frame. Yet the notion of distance between points is a geometrical one, so we expect whatever value we obtain should be independent of the reference frame we used to compute it. This means that if we use the same recipe in \\(\\bar S\\) to compute the distance using that frame’s coordinates we should get exactly same final answer. Its value should be invariant under the transformations between frames. If our space-time had an Euclidean geometry then we would calculate the distance as: \\[\n{\\rm dist}^2(P,O) = (ct_P - 0)^2 + (x_P - 0)^2,\n\\tag{3.2}\\] which is just the sum of the squares of the difference in coordinates of the two points \\(P\\) and \\(O\\). This distance is Galilean invariant, since as we saw in the last lecture coordinate differences are invariant under Galilean transformations. However, correspondingly this distance measure is not Lorentz invariant and is therefore unsuitable for the special theory of relativity.\nThe following distance measure, called the space-time interval, is Lorentz invariant: \\[\n\\Delta S^2(P,O) = (ct_P - 0)^2 - (x_P - 0)^2.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] The only modification compared to Equation 3.2 is the negative sign between the terms. However, as we shall see, this reflects a profound change in space-time from having Euclidean to Minkowski geometry. In frame \\(\\bar S\\) the same \\((c{\\rm time})^2 - ({\\rm space})^2\\) recipe for computing the space-time interval gives: \\[\n\\Delta S^2(P,O) = (c\\bar{t}_P)^2,\n\\tag{3.4}\\] since \\(P\\) is that frame’s spatial origin. You are now invited to show that this result is Lorentz invariant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Invariance of the space-time interval\nShow that the space-time interval in Equation 3.4 is Lorentz invariant as stated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Invariance of the space-time interval\nWe have that in frame \\(S\\) the interval is: \\[\n\\Delta S^2(P,O) = (ct_P)^2 - x_P^2,\n\\] while we know that in frame \\(\\bar S\\) it is given by: \\[\n\\Delta S^2(P,O) = (c\\bar{t}_P)^2.\n\\] Our task is to show these two expressions are indeed equal. To do this we inverse Lorentz transform from \\(\\bar{S}\\) to \\(S\\) as \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct_P\\\\\n  x_P  \n\\end{array}\\right) =\\gamma(\\beta)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & \\beta \\\\\n  \\beta & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  c\\bar{t}_P\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] getting \\(ct_P = \\gamma(\\beta)c\\bar{t}_P\\) and \\(x_P = \\beta\\gamma(\\beta)c\\bar{t}_P\\), so \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Delta S^2(P,O) &= (ct_P)^2 - x_P^2, \\\\\n    &= \\gamma(\\beta)^2(c\\bar{t}_P)^2 - \\beta^2\\gamma(\\beta)^2(c\\bar{t}_P)^2, \\\\\n    &= (c\\bar{t}_P)^2\\gamma(\\beta)(1-\\beta^2), \\\\\n    &= (c\\bar{t}_P)^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\] So the expressions are identical, as required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is a matter of convention whether the time or space term have the negative sign. In general relativity space – time is commonly used, while in particle physics time – space is preferred. As Equation 3.4 indicates in this course we will adopt the latter convention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe space-time interval between \\(O\\) and \\(P\\) and \\(P\\) and \\(R\\) is shown on the left. On the right we divide up space-time into three regions, time-like, null, and space-like separated based on the sign of \\(\\Delta S^2\\) from the origin.\n\n\nThe interval \\(\\Delta S^2\\) from the origin tells us something important about the nature of the separation between events \\(O\\) and \\(P\\). Specifically, we can classify the separation into three distinct types based on the sign of \\(\\Delta S^2\\):\n\nTime-like separation: If \\(\\Delta S^2 &gt; 0\\), the separation is time-like. This means that there exists a reference frame (with a \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis going through \\(O\\) and \\(P\\)) in which the two events occur at the same spatial location but at different times. Events with time-like separation can influence each other causally.\nSpace-like separation: If \\(\\Delta S^2 &lt; 0\\), the separation is space-like. This means that there exists a reference frame in which the two events occur simultaneously (with an \\(\\bar{x}\\)-axis going through \\(O\\) and \\(P\\)) but at different spatial locations. Events with space-like separation cannot influence each other causally, as they are outside each other’s light cones.\nLight-like (or null) separation: If \\(\\Delta S^2 = 0\\), the separation is light-like. This means that the two events are connected by a light signal. In this case, the events lie on the boundary of the light cone and can be connected by a photon traveling at the speed of light.\n\nThese classifications are fundamental in understanding the causal structure of space-time in the special theory of relativity.\nThere is nothing special about the origin in the calculation of the space-time interval. The interval between two points \\(P\\) and \\(R\\) is given by \\[\n\\Delta S^2(P,R) = (ct_P - ct_R)^2 - (x_P - x_R)^2 = c^2\\Delta t^2 - \\Delta x^2,\n\\tag{3.5}\\] where in the last expression we emphasise that it is calculated from the squares of coordinate differences. The generalisation of the interval to 1+3D space-time, which we will discuss more in a later lecture, is straightforward as \\(\\Delta S^2 = c^2\\Delta t^2 - \\Delta x^2 - \\Delta y^2 - \\Delta z^2\\).",

We do this by using the Lorentz transformation connecting them: \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  c\\bar{t}_P\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\gamma(\\beta)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & -\\beta \\\\\n  -\\beta & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct_P\\\\\n  x_P  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] The spatial coordinate gives \\(0 = \\gamma(\\beta)(x_P - \\beta c t_P)\\), and since \\(\\gamma(\\beta) \\neq 0\\) this gives the sensible relation \\[\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{c}\\left(\\frac{x_P}{t_P}\\right) = \\frac{v}{c}.\n\\] The time coordinate gives: \\[\nc\\bar{t}_P = \\gamma(\\beta)(ct_P - \\beta c x_P) = \\gamma(\\beta)ct_P\\left(1 -  \\left(\\frac{x_P}{ct_P}\\right)^2\\right),\n\\] \\[\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x_P}{ct_P}\\right)^2}}ct_P\\left(1 -  \\left(\\frac{x_P}{ct_P}\\right)^2\\right),\n\\] \\[\n= \\sqrt{(ct_P)^2-x_P^2} = \\sqrt{\\Delta S^2(O,P)} = s.\n\\] The time-elapsed in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) is precisely the (positive) square-root of the space-time interval between \\(O\\) and \\(P\\). This is called the proper time.\nAlthough proper time is derived from a specific reference frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) comoving with the world-line between \\(O\\) and \\(P\\), it is a crucial concept in relativity. This is because all observers of events \\(O\\) and \\(P\\) can from these events alone reconstruct the frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) and compute the time elapsed in it. So while the proper time is not a Lorentz invariant, it does have a similar special status because it is intrinsic to the observed events. So all observers can compute it and will agree on its value. As we shall see it is the preferred time coordinate in which to describe relativistic motion. We would never ascribe significance to the time measured in some other arbitrary frame precisely because it is external to the physics being observed and so we can’t guarantee all observers will know or have access to this frame.",

    "text": "3.5 Time dilation and length contraction\nLet’s now consider the unit ticks marks (in whatever units we choose) along the \\(ct\\) and \\(x\\) axes of frame \\(S\\). We know that from the origin the interval is \\(\\Delta S^2  = 1\\) for the time tick along the \\(ct\\)-axis, and \\(\\Delta S^2  = -1\\) for the space tick along the \\(x\\)-axis. We can now ask if we move along \\(x\\) what are the time coordinates \\(ct_+\\) of points with \\(\\Delta S^2  = 1\\) and \\(ct_-\\) with \\(\\Delta S^2  = -1\\). The answer is simply: \\[\nct_+ = \\sqrt{1+x^2},\n\\] and \\[\nct_- = \\sqrt{x^2-1},\n\\] respectively. These curves are hyperbola, that is they are conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone (i.e. the light cone). Armed with these curves we can now determine where the unit ticks marks are along the \\(c\\bar{t}\\) and \\(\\bar{x}\\) axes of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) as viewed in frame \\(S\\). The picture is shown here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The \\(c\\bar{t}\\) and \\(\\bar{x}\\) axes of frmae \\(\\bar{S}\\) are overlaid with the curves \\(ct_+\\) of \\(\\Delta S^2 = 1\\) and \\(ct_-\\) of \\(\\Delta S^2 = -1\\). Together these allow us to derive time dilation and length contraction.\n\n\n\nThere is quite a bit of physics in this diagram. The blue curve of \\(ct_+\\) intersects the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis at exactly the unit tick mark along this axis. Note from the picture that the time coordinate of this point is \\(\\tau &gt; 1\\). A unit of time in \\(\\bar{S}\\) thus appears to take longer in \\(S\\). This is time dilation. The intersection of the green curve \\(ct_-\\) with the \\(\\bar{x}\\) gives the unit tick mark along this axis. To determine the length of this tick mark in \\(S\\) we follow the world-line of the unit tick, which is parallel to the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis, back to the \\(x\\)-axis. One might ask why we can’t just look at the \\(x\\) coordinate of the unit tick and infer its length? If we did it would seem like we would get length expansion! But this isn’t correct since we would have then measured the front and end of a moving object at different times. The notion of “length” in a given frame requires we ascertain the location of the front and end of the object at the same time in that frame, specifically as they simultaneously cross the \\(x\\)-axis. From the picture we see this gives a length \\(\\ell &lt; 1\\), so the a unit of length in \\(\\bar{S}\\) appears smaller in \\(S\\). This is length contraction.\nEnd of Lecture 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Time dilation and length contraction\nIn Figure 3.1 we have argued that there is time dilation and length contraction between the unit intervals along the coordinate axes of \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\). Work out the expressions for the time \\(\\tau\\) and length \\(\\ell\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Time dilation and length contraction\nThe time coordinate \\(\\tau\\) in \\(S\\) of the unit tick of time in \\(\\bar{S}\\) is found easily by inverse Lorentz boosting from \\(\\bar{S}\\) to \\(S\\): \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\tau\\\\\n  x_\\tau  \n\\end{array}\\right) =\\gamma(\\beta)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & \\beta \\\\\n  \\beta & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\bar{1}\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] using that \\(\\gamma(-\\beta) = \\gamma(\\beta)\\). We quickly find that \\(\\tau = \\gamma(\\beta)\\), and hence \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\), which is time dilation. For \\(\\ell\\) we first compute the coordinates of the unit tick of length in \\(\\bar{S}\\): \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct_\\ell\\\\\n  x_\\ell  \n\\end{array}\\right) =\\gamma(\\beta)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  1 & \\beta \\\\\n  \\beta & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  0\\\\\n  \\bar{1}  \n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] and find that \\(x_\\ell = \\gamma(\\beta)\\) occuring at a time \\(ct_\\ell = \\gamma(\\beta)\\beta\\). This looks like length expansion, but we now have to project the \\(x_\\ell\\) coordinate back along its world-line to \\(t=0\\) to get \\(\\ell\\). Its world-line is given by \\(x_\\ell = \\ell + \\beta ct_\\ell\\), so \\(\\ell = x_\\ell - \\beta ct_\\ell\\) gives: \\[\n\\ell = \\gamma(\\beta)(1-\\beta^2) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma(\\beta)},\n\\] showing that \\(\\ell \\leq 1\\), which is length contraction.",

This means the space-time point for \\(ct = 1\\) occurs before the space-time point for \\(c\\bar{t}=1\\). However, in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) the opposite occurs. They see the \\(ct = 1\\) point being dilated and occuring after the point \\(c\\bar{t}=1\\). Is this a contradiction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Whose time is dilated?\nIn short no it is not a problem. The frames \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar{S}\\) both see the other frame as being dilated and so disagree on the causal ordering of the events \\(ct = 1\\) and \\(c\\bar{t} = 1\\). This is not an issue because the space-time interval between these points is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Delta S^2(ct=1,c\\bar{t}=1) &= (1 - \\gamma(\\beta))^2 - (0 - \\beta\\gamma(\\beta))^2, \\\\\n    &= 1 - 2\\gamma(\\beta) + \\gamma(\\beta)^2(1-\\beta^2), \\\\\n    &= 2(1-\\gamma(\\beta)),\n\\end{align}\n\\] and since \\(\\gamma(\\beta)\\geq 1\\) we can immediately conclude that the space-time interval \\(\\Delta S^2(ct=1,c\\bar{t}=1) \\leq 0\\), and hence these points are space-like separated. Lorentz boosts only preserve the causal ordering of time-like separated events so there is no inconsistency here. Indeed, we can find another frame \\(S'\\) where the time of the two ticks are identical (so occur simultaneously), namely one travelling \\(v/2\\) relative to \\(S\\), which is also \\(-v/2\\) relative to \\(\\bar{S}\\) which observes both ticks as being identically time dilated relative to its own tick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example exercise\n\n\n\n3. Radar Time and Operational Coordinates\nConsider an inertial observer with frame \\(\\bar S\\) moving in 1+1D space-time along the \\(x\\)-axis of frame \\(S\\). The observer carries a clock that measures proper time \\(\\tau\\). At proper time \\(\\tau_-\\) the observer emits a light signal, which reflects off a space-time event \\(P\\) and returns to the observer at proper time \\(\\tau_+\\). The radar time \\(\\tau(P)\\) and radar distance \\(\\rho(P)\\) assigned to the event \\(P\\) are defined as \\[\n\\tau(P) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_+ + \\tau_-), \\qquad\n\\rho(P) = \\frac{c}{2}(\\tau_+ - \\tau_-).\n\\]\n\nExplain the operational meaning of radar time and radar distance. Why is this definition well-defined for events that can both receive a signal from, and send a signal back to, the observer?\nSuppose the observer \\(\\bar S\\) is at rest at the spatial origin of frame \\(S\\), with worldline \\(x=0\\) and \\(t=\\tau\\). For an event \\(P\\) with coordinates \\((t,x)\\) in \\(S\\), show that \\[\n\\tau_- = t - \\frac{|x|}{c}, \\qquad \\tau_+ = t + \\frac{|x|}{c}.\n\\] and deduce that \\(\\tau(P)=t\\) and \\(\\rho(P)=|x|\\).\nNow suppose the observer \\(\\bar S\\) moves with constant velocity \\(v\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis of frame \\(S\\). The observer’s worldline is \\(x=vt\\), and its proper time satisfies \\(\\tau=\\gamma^{-1}t\\), where \\(\\gamma=(1-v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}\\). By imposing the null condition for light propagation between the observer and \\(P\\), show that the emission and reception times \\(t_\\pm\\) satisfy \\[\nc(t-t_\\pm)=\\pm(x-vt_\\pm).\n\\] Solve for \\(t_\\pm\\) and hence for \\(\\tau_\\pm\\). Show that the radar time assigned to \\(P\\) is \\[\n\\tau(P)=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right).\n\\] Compare the expression for \\(\\tau(P)\\) with the Lorentz transformation of the time \\(\\bar t\\) in frame \\(\\bar S\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Radar Time and Operational Coordinates\n\nRadar time assigns a time coordinate to a distant event using only the observer’s own clock and light signals. The radar distance is half the round-trip light travel time multiplied by \\(c\\). The definition is operationally meaningful because it relies only on proper time measurements and the invariant speed of light. It is well-defined for events that lie in the causal envelope of the observer’s worldline, so that both emission and reception signals exist.\nLight rays satisfy \\(|x|=c|t-\\tau|\\). For emission, \\(t&gt;\\tau_-\\), giving \\(\\tau_-=t-|x|/c\\). For reception, \\(\\tau_+&gt;t\\), giving \\(\\tau_+=t+|x|/c\\). Substituting, \\[\n\\tau(P)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_+ + \\tau_-)=t, \\qquad\n\\rho(P)=\\frac{c}{2}(\\tau_+-\\tau_-)=|x|.\n\\]\nA null ray between \\((t_\\pm,vt_\\pm)\\) and \\((t,x)\\) satisfies \\[\nc^2(t-t_\\pm)^2=(x-vt_\\pm)^2,\n\\] which yields \\(c(t-t_\\pm)=\\pm(x-vt_\\pm)\\). Solving, \\[\nt_\\pm=\\frac{t\\mp x/c}{1\\mp v/c}, \\qquad \\tau_\\pm=\\gamma^{-1}t_\\pm.\n\\] Computing \\[\n\\tau(P)=\\frac{\\tau_+ + \\tau_-}{2}=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right).\n\\] The Lorentz transformation to the observer’s rest frame gives \\({\\bar t}=\\gamma(t-vx/c^2)\\). Hence \\(\\tau(P)={\\bar t}(P)\\).\n\nRadar time is defined without reference to coordinates, using only light signals and proper time. However, it depends on the observer’s worldline, so different observers assign different radar times to the same event. This operational perspective clarifies the physical meaning of Lorentz time transformations.",

The distinction is highlighted by obtaining another representation of \\(\\vec{X}\\) in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) via a Lorentz transformation as \\[\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  c\\bar{t} \\\\\n  \\bar{x} \\\\\n  \\bar{y} \\\\\n  \\bar{z}\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct \\\\\n  x \\\\\n  y \\\\\n  z\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] or more compactly \\[\n\\underline{\\bar{X}} = \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\,{\\underline X},\n\\] where \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\) is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) matrix describing the Lorentz transformation. As a result we have two different column vectors \\(\\underline X\\) and \\(\\underline{\\bar{X}}\\) representing the same geometrical 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\).",

The matrix \\(\\underline{\\underline{\\eta}}\\) is called the Minkowski metric.\nAn important class of transformation in 3D Euclidean space which connect different coordinates systems are rotations given in general by \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\underline{\\underline  R}\\). For example, a rotation about the \\(x\\) axis by an angle \\(\\theta\\) is: \\[\n\\underline{\\underline{R_x}}(\\theta) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n  0 & -\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta)\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] So if \\(\\vec{r}\\) has a representation \\(\\underline r\\) in one coorindate system is has a representation \\[\n\\underline{\\bar{r}} = \\underline{\\underline R} \\, {\\underline r},\n\\] in another that is rotated with respect to it. Yet changing the coordinate system should not alter the length we compute of the geometrical vector \\(\\vec{r}\\) so \\[\n||\\vec{r}||^2 = \\underline{\\bar r}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\bar r} = {\\underline r}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\underline R}^T\\underline{\\underline R}\\,{\\underline r} = {\\underline r}^{\\rm T}{\\underline r}.\n\\] The last equality can only be true for all \\(\\vec{r}\\) if \\(\\underline{\\underline R}^T\\underline{\\underline R} = \\mathbb{1}\\), where \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is the \\(3\\times 3\\) identity matrix, which in this context is the Euclidean metric. This constraint tell us that rotation matrices \\(\\underline{\\underline{R}}\\) are orthogonal.\nLorentz transformations are \\(4\\times 4\\) matrices \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\) in 1+3D space-time defined similarly as transformations which preserve the length of 4-vectors. We know that the value of the space-time interval \\(\\Delta S^2(O,X)\\) is invariant and agreed upon by all inertial observers. However, we also know in frame \\(\\bar S\\) that \\(\\Delta S^2(O,X)\\) is given by the exactly same mathematical form \\((c\\,{\\rm time})^2 - {\\rm space}^2\\) as in Equation 4.1 so: \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = \\Delta S^2(O,X) = \\underline{\\bar{X}}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,\\underline{\\bar{X}} = (c\\bar{t})^2 - {\\bar x}^2 - {\\bar y}^2 - {\\bar z}^2,\n\\] Consequently, the same metric \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\) given in Equation 4.3 applies to every inertial frame. The invariance of the length gives us an important constraint on Lorentz transformations \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\) as: \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = \\underline{\\bar{X}}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,\\underline{\\bar{X}} = {\\underline X}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^T\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\,{\\underline X} = {\\underline X}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,{\\underline X}.\n\\] The last equality can only be true for all \\(\\vec{X}\\) if Lorentz transformations obey \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^T\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\).

    "text": "4.3 Lorentz transformations in 1+3D\nLet’s consider some special cases of Lorentz transformations. The simplest is a spatial rotation \\[\n\\underline{\\underline{\\Lambda_R}} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & - & - & - \\\\\n  0 & - & \\underline{\\underline R} & - \\\\\n  0 & - & - & -\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] which does nothing to time but rotates in space. In this case preservation of Euclidean distances in space alone ensures the space-time interval is also preserved since: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    ||\\vec{X}||^2 &= \\underline{\\bar{X}}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,\\underline{\\bar{X}}, \\\\\n    & = (ct)^2 - {\\underline r}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\underline R}^T\\underline{\\underline R}\\,{\\underline r}, \\\\\n    & = (ct)^2 - {\\underline r}^{\\rm T}{\\underline r}, \\\\\n    & = {\\underline X}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,{\\underline X},\n\\end{align}\n\\] In the first two lectures we derived a Lorentz boost in 1+1D space-time. The boost by \\(\\beta\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis in 1+3D is then: \\[\n\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}(\\beta\\vec{e}_x) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  \\gamma(\\beta) & -\\beta\\gamma(\\beta) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  -\\beta\\gamma(\\beta) & \\gamma(\\beta) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] given by inserting the \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix from earlier into the \\(ct,x\\) rows and columns in the top corner. As we saw in the previous lecture on Minkowski space-time isosurfaces of the space-time interval \\(\\Delta S^2\\) have a hyperbolic structure. As a result we can write this boost as a hyperbolic rotation: \\[\n\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}(\\beta\\vec{e}_x) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  \\cosh(\\zeta) & -\\sinh(\\zeta) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  -\\sinh(\\zeta) & \\cosh(\\zeta) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] where \\(\\zeta = \\tanh^{-1}(\\beta)\\) is the rapidity. We can write any Lorentz transformation in 1+3D as a sequence of spatial rotations and boosts along coordinates axes. In particular a boost by \\(\\beta\\) along a spatial direction defined by any unit 3-vector \\(\\vec{n}\\) can be decomposed as: \\[\n\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}(\\beta\\vec{n}) = \\underline{\\underline{\\Lambda_R}}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}(\\beta\\vec{e}_x) \\underline{\\underline{\\Lambda_R}}^{-1},\n\\] where \\(\\underline{\\underline R}^{-1}\\) rotates \\(\\vec{n}\\) into \\(\\vec{e}_x\\), a boost is applied along the \\(x\\)-axis, and then \\(\\underline{\\underline R}\\) rotates \\(\\vec{e}_x\\) back to \\(\\vec{n}\\).\n\n\n\nIsosurfaces of the space-time interval in Minkowski space-time.

    "section": "4.4 Index notation",
    "text": "4.4 Index notation\nUp to now we have used standard matrix-vector formalism to try to compactly handle coordinate transformations. This approach will continue to pop up from time to time in this course, but mostly we will exploit an alternative formalism based on indices. To begin we introduce indices denoted by latin symbols such as \\(\\mu,\\nu,\\alpha,\\tau,\\dots\\) which take the four values \\(0 \\equiv ct, 1 \\equiv x, 2 \\equiv y, 3 \\equiv z\\) over the space-time dimensions. The components of a 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\) in frame \\(S\\) are contained in the column vector \\(\\underline X\\) and we will denote the \\(\\mu\\) element of \\([{\\underline X}]_\\mu\\) as \\(x^\\mu\\). Note, the \\(\\mu\\) is an upper index and should not be confused with an exponent! More explicitly we have: \\[\n{\\underline X} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct \\\\\n  x \\\\\n  y \\\\\n  z\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  x^0 \\\\\n  x^1 \\\\\n  x^2 \\\\\n  x^3\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] The expansion of the 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\) in the basis of \\(S\\) in Equation 4.2 is then: \\[\n\\vec{X} = x^0\\,\\vec{e}_{ct} + x^1\\,\\vec{e}_x + x^2\\,\\vec{e}_y + x^3\\,\\vec{e}_z.\n\\] We can also replace the labels on basis vectors with the same index \\(\\mu\\) giving: \\[\n\\vec{X} = \\sum_{\\mu=0}^3 x^\\mu\\,\\vec{e}_{\\mu}.\n\\tag{4.4}\\] Next, we can adopt Einstein convention and assume whenever there is a repeated upper and lower index we mean a summation like in Equation 4.4 is to be performed. This leaves: \\[\n\\vec{X} = x^\\mu\\,\\vec{e}_{\\mu}.\n\\tag{4.5}\\] The repeated upper and lower \\(\\mu\\) index is called a contraction. Since the index \\(\\mu\\) is summed over it is a “dummy” index and we are completely free to relabel it to any other latin symbol so \\[\n\\vec{X} = x^\\alpha\\,\\vec{e}_{\\alpha},\n\\] also holds. This convention will prove to be very useful for keeping potentially cumbersome expressions compact.\nPerhaps an even more compelling reason to adopt the index formalism is that it signifies more clearly a change in frame. In matrix-vector formalism we have \\[\n\\underline{\\bar{X}} = \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\,{\\underline X},\n\\] which in terms of elements is: \\[\n[\\underline{\\bar{X}}]_\\mu = \\sum_{\\nu=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}]_{\\mu\\nu}[{\\underline X}]_\\nu.\n\\] In index notation this expression becomes: \\[\nx^{\\bar{\\mu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\nu x^\\nu,\n\\tag{4.6}\\] where \\(x^{\\bar{\\mu}} = [\\underline{\\bar{X}}]_\\bar{\\mu}\\), \\(x^\\nu = [{\\underline X}]_\\nu\\) and \\(\\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\nu = [\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}]_{\\bar{\\mu}\\nu}\\). Quite a few comments are in order about Equation 4.6. For elements of matrices and vectors we conventionally write only lower indices to avoid confusion with exponents and because in linear algebra there is no need to have distinct upper and lower type indices. We have chosen to give the components of 4-vectors \\(x^\\mu\\) an upper index, so in Equation 4.6 consistency with the Einstein convention then requires us to use both upper and lower indices on \\(\\Lambda\\). A useful new bit of notation in Equation 4.6 is that we have placed a bar above the index \\(\\bar{\\mu}\\) to denote that the components being indexed over are for frame \\(\\bar S\\). We can take Equation 4.6 as fundamental and arrive at the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a 4-vector\n\n\n\nA 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) is a geometrical object with components \\(a^\\mu\\) in frame \\(S\\) which transforms into another frame \\(\\bar S\\) as: \\[\na^{\\bar{\\mu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\nu a^\\nu.\n\\] Hence, any set of 4 components which transform this way is a bonifide 4-vector.\n\n\nGiven Equation 4.6 expresses how components in \\(\\bar S\\) are constructed from those in \\(S\\) it is natural to ask how to invert this expansion. In matrix-vector notation we want: \\[\n{\\underline X} = \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}\\,\\underline{\\bar{X}},\n\\] The equivalent index expansion for this equation is \\[\nx^{\\alpha} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar \\beta} x^{\\bar \\beta}.\n\\] where we have used \\(\\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar \\beta} = [\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}]_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}}\\). We don’t need to distinguish the inverse transformation with a \\(\\circ^{-1}\\). Instead we treat \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar S\\) on an equal footing since we can now unambiguously identify what the Lorentz transformation does by examining its indices. Specifically, the upper index is the destination frame and lower index is the originating frame for transformations of 4-vectors. Hence:\n\nTransform from \\(S \\rightarrow \\bar S\\) is \\(\\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\nu\\).\nTransform from \\({\\bar S} \\rightarrow S\\) is \\(\\Lambda^{\\nu}_{\\bar \\mu}\\).\n\nIn matrix-vector notation the transformation from \\({\\bar S} \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow {\\bar S}\\) is given by: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1} &= \\mathbb{1}, \\\\\n    [\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}]_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}} &= [\\mathbb{1}]_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}} = \\delta_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}},\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is the \\(4\\times 4\\) identity matrix here and \\(\\delta_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}}\\) is the Kronecker delta symbol which is 1 if \\(\\bar{\\alpha}=\\bar{\\beta}\\) and zero otherwise. Since we start and end at \\(\\bar S\\) indices are all barred and the net effect is the identity, i.e. no change. This converts to an index expression as: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\sum_{\\mu=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}]_{{\\bar \\alpha}\\mu}[\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}]_{\\mu\\bar{\\beta}} &= \\delta_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}}, \\\\\n    &~{\\boldsymbol \\downarrow}\\\\\n    \\Lambda^{\\bar \\alpha}_\\mu \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\beta} &= \\delta^\\bar{\\alpha}_\\bar{\\beta},\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.7}\\] The opposite transformation from \\(S \\rightarrow {\\bar S} \\rightarrow S\\) is given by: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda} &= \\mathbb{1}, \\\\\n    [\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}]_{\\alpha\\beta} & = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] which converts to the index expression: \\[\n\\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\beta}\\Lambda^{\\bar \\beta}_\\nu = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu.\n\\tag{4.8}\\]  It is already evident here that the matrix notation is somewhat clunky and potentially confusing which is the reason we will, for the most part, use index notation instead.In index notation equations you may find when they appear later they have different index symbols. This is done delibrately to illustrate the freedom of relabelling dummy indices.",

    "section": "4.5 Transformation of basis 4-vectors",
    "text": "4.5 Transformation of basis 4-vectors\nThe fundamental reason we need upper and lower indices is that they actually denote different geometrical objects. The full implications of this will become clearer over the next few lectures. For now we can see why this is necessary by considering how basis 4-vectors \\(\\vec{e}_\\mu\\) transform between frames. Earlier we gave these objects lower indices which made the expansion in Equation 4.5 consistent with Einstein notation. However, the reason is deeper than this. Take the 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\). As a geometrical object it has different expansions in every frame so: \\[\n\\vec{X} = x^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu = x^{\\bar\\mu}\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\mu}.\n\\] If we insert the transformation Equation 4.6 then the following rearrangements and index relabelling gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n   x^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu &= x^{\\bar\\alpha}\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\alpha}, \\\\\n   &= \\Lambda^{\\bar\\alpha}_\\nu x^\\nu \\vec{e}_{\\bar\\alpha}, \\\\\n   &= \\Lambda^{\\bar\\nu}_\\mu x^\\mu \\vec{e}_{\\bar\\nu}, \\\\\n   x^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\mu - \\Lambda^{\\bar\\nu}_\\mu \\vec{e}_{\\bar\\nu}) &= 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\] For the last line to be true for all 4-vectors \\(\\vec{X}\\) it must be that the basis 4-vectors transform as \\[\n\\vec{e}_\\mu = \\Lambda^{\\bar\\nu}_\\mu\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\nu}.\n\\tag{4.9}\\] If you read this equation carefully you will notice it is backwards compared to Equation 4.6 since it constructs quantities in \\(S\\) in terms of those in \\(\\bar S\\). We use Equation 4.7 to invert the expression as: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n   \\vec{e}_\\mu &= \\Lambda^{\\bar\\alpha}_\\mu\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\alpha}, \\\\\n    \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu}\\vec{e}_\\mu &= \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu}\\Lambda^{\\bar\\alpha}_\\mu\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\alpha}, \\\\\n    \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu}\\vec{e}_\\mu &= \\delta^{\\bar \\alpha}_{\\bar\\nu}\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\alpha}, \\\\\n    \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu}\\vec{e}_\\mu &= \\vec{e}_{\\bar\\nu},\n\\end{align}\n\\] Consequently, basis 4-vectors in \\(\\bar S\\) are given by \\[\n\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\nu} = \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu}\\vec{e}_\\mu\n\\tag{4.10}\\] where the inversion compared to the expression for the components \\[\nx^{\\bar \\mu} = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_\\nu x^\\nu,\n\\tag{4.11}\\] is clear. What does this mean? Having an upper index, like components of a 4-vector, transforms from \\(S\\) to \\(\\bar S\\) with a standard Lorentz transformation as we derived for space-time coordinates. However, having a lower index means those objects transform from \\(S\\) to \\(\\bar S\\) via the inverse of the standard Lorentz transformation. As we shall see later such objects whose components transform this way are different to 4-vectors and deserving of a different name called one-forms.\n\n\n\nAn illustration in 1+1D of the basis 4-vectors of \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar S\\) as viewed from frame \\(S\\) itself. Any 4-vectors in space-time can thus be expanded in either basis set.\n\n\nTo finish you are invited below to confirm a sensible property of these transformations - take the expansion of a 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\) in the basis of \\(\\bar S\\) and recover the expansion in \\(S\\).\nEnd of Lecture 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Transforming a 4-vector expansion\nLet’s take the expansion of a 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\) in the basis of \\(\\bar S\\) and insert both Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11 to show that we recover its expansion in \\(S\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Transforming a 4-vector expansion\nInserting into the expansion both Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11 gives \\[\n\\begin{align}\n   \\vec{X} &= x^\\bar{\\mu}\\vec{e}_{\\bar\\mu}, \\\\\n     &= \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_{\\nu} x^\\nu \\Lambda^\\alpha_{\\bar\\mu}\\vec{e}_{\\alpha}, \\\\\n    &= \\Lambda^\\alpha_{\\bar\\mu} \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_{\\nu}~  x^\\nu \\vec{e}_{\\alpha}, \\\\\n    &= \\delta^\\alpha_\\nu x^\\nu \\vec{e}_{\\alpha}, \\\\\n    &= x^\\nu \\vec{e}_{\\nu}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] This simply confirms that by transforming both the components and the basis 4-vectors we obtain the expansion of \\(\\vec{X}\\) in frame \\(S\\). Notice for this to work we needed the components and basis 4-vectors to transform oppositely so the object they describe, a 4-vector, is a genuine geometrical object.",

    "text": "5.1 Scalar-product of 4-vectors\nIn the last lecture we stated that the length of a 4-vector \\(||\\vec{X}||\\) is given by the space-time interval between \\(O\\) and \\(X\\) as: \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = \\Delta S^2(0,X).\n\\] The representation of this 4-vector in frame \\(S\\) was packaged up into a column vector \\[\n{\\underline X} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  x^0 \\\\\n  x^1 \\\\\n  x^2 \\\\\n  x^3\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] and from \\(S^2(0,X) = (x^0)^2 - (x^1)^2 - (x^2)^2 - (x^3)^2\\) we got: \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = {\\underline X}^T\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,{\\underline X},\n\\tag{5.1}\\] using the metric \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta} = {\\rm diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)\\). Converting Equation 5.1 into index notation gives: \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}x^\\mu x^\\nu,\n\\tag{5.2}\\] where \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline \\eta}]_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric. In another frame \\(\\bar S\\) we have \\[\n||\\vec{X}||^2 = \\eta_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}}x^{\\bar \\mu} x^{\\bar \\nu},\n\\tag{5.3}\\] where \\(\\eta_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}} = [\\underline{\\underline \\eta}]_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}}\\) takes its elements from the same matrix \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\). This means that \\[\n\\eta_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\beta}} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\alpha}\\Lambda^\\nu_{\\bar \\beta}.\n\\] as you are now invited to show.\nIn Euclidean 3D space we have a scalar (or dot) product which takes two 3-vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) and returns a scalar: \\[\n\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = {\\underline a}^{\\rm T}{\\underline b} = a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z.\n\\] which is symmetric in its arguments \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = \\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a}\\). The length of a vector is then a special case as \\(||\\vec{r}||^2 = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r}\\). So more generally we see that the orthogonality of rotations \\(\\underline{\\underline R}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\underline R} = \\mathbb{1}\\) ensures the invariance of the scalar product: \\[\n\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = \\bar{\\underline a}^{\\rm T}\\bar{\\underline b} = {\\underline a}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\underline R}^{\\rm T}\\underline{\\underline R}\\,{\\underline b} = {\\underline a}^{\\rm T}{\\underline b}.\n\\] Since \\(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = ||\\vec{a}||\\,||\\vec{b}|| \\cos(\\phi)\\) we see that rotations preserve not only the length but also the angle \\(\\phi\\) between 3-vectors.\nFor 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) in Minkowski space-time we can similarly construct a scalar product as: \\[\n\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B} = \\underline{A}^{\\rm T}\\,\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\,{\\underline B} = A^0B^0 - A^1B^1 - A^2B^2 - A^3B^3,\n\\] which in index notation is \\[\n\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}A^\\mu B^\\nu.\n\\tag{5.6}\\] Again we see that \\(\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{A}\\) owing to the metric being diagonal and hence symmetric. We can easily confirm that the scalar product is Lorentz invariant based on knowing already that the length or space-time interval is. Take: \\[\n(\\vec{A}+\\vec{B})\\cdot(\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}) = \\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{A} + \\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{B} + 2\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B},\n\\] where the lefthand side and all but the last term on the righthand side are lengths of 4-vectors, and hence invariant. This implies \\(\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B}\\) must be invariant also. This generalisation in Equation 5.6 is our first hint that if we have expressions involving the full contraction of all indices the resulting scalar is a Lorentz invariant. We will firm this conjecture up in the coming lectures. Finally, we see that the scalar product of our basis 4-vectors obeys: \\[\n\\vec{e}_\\mu \\cdot \\vec{e}_\\nu = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu},\n\\] reflecting their orthogonality and unit 4-vector nature.",

    "text": "5.2 Constructing one-forms\nIt is time for us to consider more closely what objects possess components that are lower indices. To start we observe that the set of all 4-vectors \\(\\vec{X}\\) in Minkowski space-time form a vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). What this means formally is that 4-vectors obey the axioms of a vector space. Recall a vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) over reals \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is a set equipped with two operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication, that satisfy the following axioms:\n\nClosure under addition: For all \\(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), the sum \\(\\vec{u} + \\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\).\nAssociativity of addition: For all \\(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}, \\vec{w} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\((\\vec{u} + \\vec{v}) + \\vec{w} = \\vec{u} + (\\vec{v} + \\vec{w})\\).\nCommutativity of addition: For all \\(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\(\\vec{u} + \\vec{v} = \\vec{v} + \\vec{u}\\).\nExistence of additive identity: There exists an element \\(\\vec{0} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) such that for all \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\(\\vec{v} + \\vec{0} = \\vec{v}\\).\nExistence of additive inverse: For each \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), there exists an element \\(-\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\vec{v} + (-\\vec{v}) = \\vec{0}\\).\nClosure under scalar multiplication: For all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), the product \\(a\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\).\nAssociativity of scalar multiplication: For all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\(a(b\\vec{v}) = (ab)\\vec{v}\\).\nDistributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition: For all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\(a(\\vec{u} + \\vec{v}) = a\\vec{u} + a\\vec{v}\\).\nDistributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition: For all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\((a + b)\\vec{v} = a\\vec{v} + b\\vec{v}\\).\nExistence of multiplicative identity: For all \\(\\vec{v} \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), \\(1\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}\\), where \\(1\\) is the multiplicative identity in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nThe crucial axioms are the ones giving closure 1. and 6., while the rest just establish sensible behaviour of the two operations.\nNext consider an ordinary function \\(f(x)\\) which takes a scalar \\(x\\) and maps it to another scalar \\(y\\), so \\[\nf:x\\in\\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] as depicted in this figure:\n\n\n\nA function \\(f\\) maps a point \\(x\\) from the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(y\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) as \\(f(x) = y\\).\n\n\nNow suppose we want an object that \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) that maps a 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) to scalar \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) as: \\[\n\\tilde{Q}:\\vec{A}\\in\\mathcal{M} \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\] As this object acts on a non-scalar input it is called a functional and we will distinguish it from an ordinary function with a \\(\\tilde{\\cdot}\\) above its symbol. Similar to a function we can depict a one-form like this:An example of a functional you may have encountered already is a definite integral \\[\n\\tilde{F}(f(x)) = \\int_{-1}^1 {\\rm d}x f(x),\n\\] which maps a function \\(f(x)\\) to a scalar.\n\n\n\nA linear functional \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) maps a 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) from \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to a scalar \\(y\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) as \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) = y\\).\n\n\nWe can define the scalar multiplication by \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) of a functional \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and a new functional \\(\\tilde{R} = \\alpha\\tilde{Q}\\) whose output \\(\\tilde{R}(\\vec{A}) = \\alpha\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) is the multiplication of the output of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) by \\(\\alpha\\). We can also define the addition of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) with another functional \\(\\tilde{P}\\) as a new functional \\(\\tilde{R} = \\tilde{Q} + \\tilde{P}\\) whose output \\(\\tilde{R}(\\vec{A}) = \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) + \\tilde{P}(\\vec{A})\\) is the sum of the outputs of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\). We thus have the basic ingredients needed for constructing another vector space from functionals.\nBefore proceeding we restrict our considerations to linear functionals. This means, like ordinary functions, they obey following: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\tilde{Q}(\\alpha\\vec{A}) &= \\alpha\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}), \\\\\n    \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}+\\vec{B}) &= \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) + \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{B}).\n\\end{align}\n\\] The set of all linear functionals on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) thus form a new vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) called the dual vector space of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVector spaces and their duals will not be entirely new concepts to you. In linear algebra the set of row vectors forms a dual space to the set of column vectors. Row vectors are linear functionals acting on column vectors via left multiplication. Similarly, in quantum mechanics bras \\(\\langle \\psi| \\in \\mathcal{H}^*\\) are the duals of kets \\(|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) is the complex linear vector space or Hilbert space of the system.\n\n\nWe will call the vectors in the dual space \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) one-forms. This name comes from deeper differential geometry which will only touch upon in this course. What is crucial here is that one-forms, like 4-vectors, are abstract geometrical objects. We will denote one-forms using the \\(\\tilde{\\cdot}\\) functional notation.\nSince one-forms are linear functionals we can entirely characterise their behaviour by acting them on basis 4-vectors. Specifically, the components of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) are extracted as: \\[\nQ_\\mu = \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{e}_\\mu),\n\\] where we note that they possess a lower index inherited from the basis 4-vector. Given these components we can then construct the action of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) on any input 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) as: \\[\n\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) = \\tilde{Q}(A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu) = A^\\mu\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{e}_\\mu) = A^\\mu Q_\\mu.\n\\] The lefthand side of the above equation is a scalar formed from geometrical objects. It has to be Lorentz invariant, while the far righthand side is the calculation of this scalar from components in a particular frame \\(S\\). Indeed geometrically a one-form can be viewed as a sequence of surfaces in space-time, while a 4-vector is an arrow. The scalar value of \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) then has a geometrical interpretation as the number of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) surfaces pierced by \\(\\vec{A}\\), as depicted here:\n\n\n\nWe can view \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) as a stack of surfaces, as shown here for integer separations along some direction. The value of \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) is then the number of surfaces pierced by a 4-vector. For \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{C}\\) some whole number are threaded through, but for \\(\\vec{B}\\) none are since it lies along the surface.\n\n\nNaturally, the next question is how do the components of one-forms transform between frames. This is answered easily by inserting the transformation for basis 4-vectors as: \\[\n\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{e}_\\mu) = Q_\\mu = \\tilde{Q}(\\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\mu\\vec{e}_{\\bar \\nu}) = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\mu\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{e}_{\\bar \\nu}) = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\mu Q_{\\bar \\nu}.\n\\] Inverting this expression gives: \\[\nQ_{\\bar \\nu} = \\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\nu} Q_{\\mu},\n\\] where we see that the components of one-forms transform oppositely to those of 4-vectors. In fact they transform the same way as the basis 4-vectors themselves which is why you may see them referred to as covariant vectors, while 4-vectors are correspondingly referred to as contravariant vectors. We won’t use this old-fashioned language in this course.\nBy transforming oppositely to 4-vectors it ensures that \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) is a Lorentz invariant. This is confirmed by computing: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) &= Q_{\\bar \\nu} A^{\\bar \\nu}, \\\\\n    &= \\left(\\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\nu} Q_{\\mu}\\right)\\left(\\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_{\\alpha} A^\\alpha\\right), \\\\\n    &= \\left(\\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\nu}\\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_{\\alpha}\\right)Q_\\mu A^\\alpha, \\\\\n    &= \\delta^\\mu_\\alpha Q_\\mu A^\\alpha, \\\\\n    &= Q_\\mu A^\\mu,\n\\end{align}\n\\] where the expression of \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) in frame \\(\\bar S\\) is transformed into its equivalent expression in frame \\(S\\). What is computed here is called the contraction of a one-form with a 4-vector.\nGiven we have components \\(Q_\\mu\\) of a one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) we should specify what they are the expansion coefficients of. We expect there should be some basis one-forms in \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) which reconstruct the one-form as: \\[\n\\tilde{Q} = Q_\\mu \\tilde{e}^\\mu.\n\\] Reconsidering \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\) we find that \\[\n\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) = Q_\\mu\\tilde{e}^\\mu(A^\\nu\\vec{e}_\\nu) = Q_\\mu A^\\nu\\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\nu) \\overset{?}{=} A^\\mu Q_\\mu.\n\\] The final equality only applies if \\(\\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\nu) = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\). This relation is called biorthonormality of the one-form basis generated by the 4-vector basis. We can then guess that basis one-forms transform between frames as: \\[\n\\tilde{e}^{\\bar \\mu} = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_\\nu \\tilde{e}^{\\nu},\n\\] so they transform identically to the components of 4-vectors, as expected due to the upper index they possess.\nThe duality between \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) means we can equally view 4-vectors as linear functionals of one-forms as \\(\\vec{A}(\\tilde{Q})\\). This suggests we should introduce a more symmetrical notation for their contraction as: \\[\n\\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{A} \\rangle = \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A}) = \\vec{A}(\\tilde{Q}),\n\\] and components follow as \\(A^\\mu = \\vec{A}(\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = \\langle \\tilde{e}^\\mu, \\vec{A} \\rangle\\) and \\(Q_\\mu = \\tilde{Q}(\\vec{e}_\\mu) = \\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{e}_\\mu \\rangle\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a one-form\n\n\n\nA one-form \\(\\vec{Q}\\) is a geometrical object with components \\(Q_\\mu\\) in frame \\(S\\) which transforms into another frame \\(\\bar S\\) as: \\[\nQ_{\\bar{\\mu}} = \\Lambda^{\\nu}_{\\bar{\\mu}} Q_\\nu.\n\\] Hence, any set of 4 components which transform this way is a bonifide one-form.\n\n\nGiven one-forms are memebers of a dual vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) we expect they should also have their own scalar-product defining the length of a one-form and orthogonality between them. Moreover, this scalar-product should be a Lorentz invariant quantity. Analogous with 4-vectors we can define the scalar-product between two one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\) as \\[\n    \\tilde{Q}\\cdot\\tilde{P} = Q_0P_0 - Q_1P_1 - Q_2P_2 - Q_3P_3 = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}Q_\\mu P_\\nu,\n\\tag{5.7}\\] where \\(\\eta^{\\mu\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline \\eta}]_{\\mu\\nu}\\) has elements derived from the same \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\) matrix used above in the section Scalar-product of 4-vectors earlier. The proof that Equation 5.7 is Lorentz invariant is identical to that earlier for 4-vectors just with \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}\\) replaced with \\(\\underline{\\underline \\Lambda}^{-1}\\).",

    "text": "5.3 Fields and their space-time derivatives\nThis course is about fields. Mathematically we can view the simplest possible field as a general Lorentz scalar functional \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}(\\vec{X})\\) of the space-time points specified by a 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\). By formally being a functional of the geometrical object \\(\\vec{X}\\) we are making it clear the field is not tied to any particular reference frame. In any given frame \\(S\\) in which \\(\\vec{X}\\) has components \\(x^\\mu\\) the field can be considered a function of these components: \\[\n\\tilde{\\varphi}(\\vec{X}) \\overset{S}{\\rightarrow} \\varphi(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3) = \\varphi(x^\\mu) = \\varphi(x)\n\\] There are a couple of notations introduced above which need explaining. First, ocassionally it is useful to write \\(\\varphi(x^\\mu) = \\varphi(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3)\\). This is a slight abuse of our index notation since \\(\\mu\\) here is a shorthand for \\(\\varphi\\) being a function of all components in frame \\(S\\). It is not a free index which participates in any index manipulations outside of the argument parentheses of \\(\\varphi\\). Second, for brevity we will also just write \\(\\varphi(x) = \\varphi(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3)\\), and it should be clear from the context when we mean this or just the coordinate along the \\(x\\)-axis (see the example below). This notation is useful when we want to find the function that represents \\(\\varphi\\) in another frame \\(\\bar S\\). We use that the value of \\(\\varphi\\) at any point \\(\\vec{X}\\) is unchanged as: \\[\n\\tilde{\\varphi}(\\vec{X}) \\overset{S}{\\rightarrow} \\varphi(x^\\mu) = \\varphi(\\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\bar \\nu} x^{\\bar \\nu}) = \\bar{\\varphi}(x^{\\bar \\nu}).\n\\] What we have done in these steps is to take the function \\(\\varphi(x^\\mu)\\) in \\(S\\) and then perform an inverse Lorentz transformation on its arguments (nicely handled by the index \\(\\mu\\)) to convert them into components in frame \\(\\bar S\\). We then identify this with the function \\(\\bar{\\varphi}(x^{\\bar \\nu})\\) describing the field in \\(\\bar S\\). A \\(\\bar{\\circ}\\) is put on the function as well to make it clear it is in general a different function of the components in \\(\\bar S\\) than \\(\\varphi\\) and not just the same function with its \\(x^\\mu\\) arguments replaced with \\(x^{\\bar \\nu}\\). The transformations of functions between reference frames was discussed earlier in Principle of relativity. In short we see that \\(\\varphi(x) = \\bar{\\varphi}(\\bar{x})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforming fields between frames\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a concrete example to illustrate the transformation of fields in 1+1D. Suppose we have a field specified by the following function : \\[\n\\varphi(ct,x) = {\\rm Re}\\{\\tan^{-1}(x + i ct)\\}.\n\\tag{5.8}\\] This is plotted in frame \\(S\\) in the left panel of Figure 5.1. If we then insert the inverse Lorentz transformation from \\(S\\) to \\(\\bar S\\) we then get: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\bar{\\varphi}(c\\bar{t},\\bar{x}) &= {\\rm Re}\\left\\{\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\gamma(\\beta)\\bar{x} + \\beta\\gamma(\\beta)c\\bar{t} + i\\gamma(\\beta)c\\bar{t} + i\\beta\\gamma(\\beta)\\bar{x}\\right)\\right\\}. \\\\\n&= {\\rm Re}\\left\\{\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\gamma(\\beta)(1+ i\\beta)\\bar{x} + i\\gamma(\\beta)(1-i\\beta)c\\bar{t}\\right)\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.9}\\] What is clear here is that \\(\\bar{\\varphi}(c\\bar{t},\\bar{x})\\) is a different function of its arguments compared to \\(\\varphi(ct,x)\\) owing to the complex factors \\(\\gamma(\\beta)(1 \\pm i\\beta)\\). As can be seen in the right panel of Figure 5.1 the new function \\(\\bar{\\varphi}(c\\bar{t},\\bar{x})\\) appears distorted since the \\(ct\\) and \\(x\\) axes of \\(S\\) are rotated by \\(\\tan(\\beta)\\) in \\(\\bar S\\). Nonetheless the value of the field at any given point in space-time is completely unchanged and agreed upon by both frames. Take the point \\(\\vec{X}\\) labelled in Figure 5.1 which has coordinates in \\(S\\): \\[{\\bf X} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  2\\\\\n  \\pi/2  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Evaluating the field using Equation 5.8 gives \\(\\varphi(\\vec{X}) = \\varphi({\\bf X}) = 1.31\\). Lorentz transforming to \\(\\bar S\\) then gives coordinates for \\(\\vec{X}\\) as: \\[\\bar{{\\bf X}} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1.50\\\\\n  0.84  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Evaluating the field using Equation 5.9 gives \\(\\varphi(\\vec{X}) = \\bar{\\varphi}(\\bar{\\bf X}) = 1.31\\), as it must.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: In the left panel a contour plot in 1+1D of the field \\(\\varphi(ct,x) = {\\rm Re}\\{\\tan^{-1}(x + i ct)\\}\\) in frame \\(S\\). In the right panel the same field is shown in the coordinates of frame \\(\\bar{S}\\). The same space-time point \\(\\vec{X}\\) is highlighted in both frames to illustrate that the value of the field is unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, this function was chosen for no other reason than it produces a nice plot in Figure 5.1. It has no deeper physical significance here.One of the most important and basic properties of a field that we will repeatedly need to compute is its derivative in space-time. Formally, we compute this by considering the field at two nearby points \\(\\vec{X}\\) and \\(\\vec{X}+\\delta\\vec{X}\\) where \\(\\delta\\vec{X}\\) is a small 4-vector connecting the points, as shown in Figure 5.2. We then proceed to compute the Taylor expansion of the field \\(\\varphi\\) about the point \\(\\vec{X}+\\delta\\vec{X}\\) as: \\[\n\\varphi(x^\\mu+\\delta x^\\mu) = \\varphi(x^\\mu) + \\sum_{\\nu=0}^3\\delta x^\\nu \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x^\\nu}\\right|_{\\vec{X}} + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta x^2).\n\\tag{5.10}\\] Now the first term \\(\\varphi(x^\\mu)\\) is a Lorentz scalar since it is the field itself. However, we are uncertain at this point what the status of the second term is, which is the reason we have written the sum out explicitly. We know the entire Taylor series should be Lorentz scalar but we don’t know off hand that every term is a Lorentz scalar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: The derivative of a field, illustrated here for some example field in 1+1D, is based on comparing two nearby points \\(\\vec{X}\\) and \\(\\vec{X}+\\delta\\vec{X}\\) in space-time. A 4-vector \\(\\delta\\vec{X}\\) connects them and the value of the field at each point is a Lorentz scalar, which makes allows us to define a derivative as a one-form.\n\n\n\nNow, we do know that \\(\\delta x^\\nu\\) is a valid 4-vector but what type of object is the derivative of the field? We would like to identify it as a bonifide one-form \\[\nK_\\nu = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x^\\nu},\n\\]  since then the second term is a contraction \\(\\delta x^\\nu K_\\nu\\), using Einstein summation convention, is a manifestly a Lorentz scalar also.The rule you see for identifying \\(K_\\nu\\) here is that an upper index on the demoninator of a derivative behaves like a lower index overall.\nTo determine whether \\(K_\\nu\\) is a one-form we have to establish how it transforms between frames. For this we use the chain-rule to establish the relation between partial derivatives in different frames as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu} = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}}.\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain-rule reminder\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have function \\(f(x,y)\\) in term of two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We also have two other variables \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) in which we can express the original variables in terms of as \\(x(r,s)\\) and \\(y(r,s)\\). Subsitution into \\(f\\) gives this function in terms of the new variables \\(f(r,s) = f(x(r,s),y(r,s))\\). The chain-rule allows us to connect derivatives in \\(r,s\\) with those in \\(x,y\\) and the transformation connecting them as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f(r,s)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x(r,s)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y(r,s)}{\\partial r},\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f(r,s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x(r,s)}{\\partial s} + \\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y(r,s)}{\\partial s}.\n\\] This can expressed as \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\end{array}\\right)f = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial s} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s} \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\end{array}\\right)f,\n\\] where the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix is the Jacobian \\(\\bf J\\) for this coordinate transformations. This expression can be generalised readily to coordinates \\(x^\\mu\\) in frame \\(S\\) and \\(x^\\bar{\\nu}\\) in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) in \\(1+3\\) space-time as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu} = \\sum_{\\nu=0}^3 \\frac{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}}.\n\\] The crucial observation here is that the Lorentz transformation is linear (as we argued earlier in Principle of relativity on general grounds) as \\[\nx^\\bar{\\nu} = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu x^\\mu,\n\\] hence we immediately see that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu,\n\\] so we have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu} = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}},\n\\] as claimed.\n\n\n\nUsing Equation 5.11 we see that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x^\\nu} = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}},\n\\] \\[\nK_\\mu = \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu K_\\bar{\\nu},\n\\] hence confirming that \\(K_\\mu\\) does indeed transform exactly like a one-form.\nMore generally, we can identify Equation 5.11 as defining a one-form differential operator which we write more compactly as \\[\n\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}, \\quad {\\rm and} \\quad \\partial_\\bar{\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\bar{\\nu}},\n\\] so Equation 5.11 becomes the form we will use from now on \\[\n\\partial_\\mu= \\Lambda^\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\partial_\\bar{\\nu}.\n\\tag{5.12}\\] Returning to Equation 5.10 we have \\[\n\\varphi(x^\\mu+\\delta x^\\mu) = \\varphi(x^\\mu) + \\delta x^\\nu \\left.\\partial_\\nu \\varphi\\right|_{\\vec{X}} + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta x^2).\n\\] which we can identify a familiar first principles expression for the derivative of the field at point \\(\\vec{X}\\) as \\[\n\\left.\\partial_\\nu \\varphi\\right|_{\\vec{X}} = \\lim_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\varphi(x^\\mu+\\delta x^\\mu) - \\varphi(x^\\mu)}{\\delta x^\\mu}.\n\\] In frame \\(S\\) the one-form \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) can be written as \\[\n\\partial_\\mu = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\nabla \\end{array}\\right),\n\\] from which it is clear that the 4-vector version of it is \\[\n\\partial^\\mu = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\nu = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\\\\n-\\nabla \\end{array}\\right).\n\\] The negative sign on the 4-vector components points to the derivative being a natural one-form.\nFinally, we can contract the one-form and 4-vector derivative to get a Lorentz scalar differential operator \\[\n\\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^2} -\\nabla^2,\n\\] which is of such crucial importance for our work to come that it is named the d’Alembert operator. Indeed the wave equation can now be expressed very succinctly as \\[\n\\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu \\varphi = 0,\n\\] where its relativistic covariance is now completely apparent.\nEnd of Lecture 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

    "text": "6.1 Rank-2 tensors\nIn the last lecture we expanded our repertoire of geometrical objects by constructing one-forms as linear functionals of 4-vectors. Given one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) we obtain a Lorentz scalar \\(\\tilde{Q}(\\vec{A})\\). The duality of this construction means that we could eqaually view 4-vectors as linear functionals of one-forms, so we get the same Lorentz scalar as \\(\\vec{A}(\\tilde{Q})\\). We can write this more symmetrically as \\(\\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{A} \\rangle\\). Pictorially we can view these two objects as:\nUsing the basis \\(\\vec{e}_\\mu\\) spanning the vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) of 4-vectors we have the expansion \\[\n    \\vec{A} = A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu.\n\\] The 4-vector basis then generates a biorthonormal basis of one-forms \\(\\tilde{e}^\\mu\\) obeying \\(\\langle \\tilde{e}^\\mu, \\vec{e}_\\nu \\rangle = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\), from which one-forms are expanded as \\[\n    \\tilde{Q} = Q_\\mu\\tilde{e}^\\mu.\n\\] The contraction is then \\(\\langle \\tilde{Q}, \\vec{A} \\rangle = Q_\\mu A^\\mu\\).\nIn this lecture we will generalise this construction to more general objects called tensors. Indeed 4-vectors and one-forms are tensors. Specifically, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\textrm{4-vector} &\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right)~{\\rm tensor},\\\\\n     \\textrm{one-form} &\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)~{\\rm tensor},\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] where the notation \\(({M \\atop N})\\) denotes a tensor with \\(M\\) upper 4-vector-like indices, or alternatively an object that ‘eats’ \\(M\\) one-forms, and \\(N\\) lower one-form-like indices, or eats \\(N\\) 4-vectors. We will denote a general tensor as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\). The next simplest tensor is rank-2 with 2 indices, for example a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor which is a linear functional on two 4-vectors \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\vec{A}\\in\\mathcal{M},\\vec{B}\\in\\mathcal{M} \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nJust as with 4-vectors and one-forms we can full determine the action of this linear object by acting it on basis 4-vectors for each of the vector spaces \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) it acts on as \\[\n    T_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\vec{e}_\\beta).\n\\] As expected for a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor its components have two lower indices. To complete the circle, how can these components reconstruct the geometrical object \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\)? They correspond to how much tensor product basis of one-forms \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\) contribute to \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\). Notice how \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\) is a type \\(({0 \\atop 1})\\) tensor, as is \\(\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\), hence \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta\\) is an elementary type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor. The components \\(T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\) then reconstruct the tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\,\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta.\n\\] If we now act \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on two 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) we can explicitly compute this as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) &= \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu,B^\\nu\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\textrm{expand 4-vectors}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}\\tilde{e}^\\alpha(A^\\mu\\vec{e}_\\mu)\\tilde{e}^\\beta(B^\\nu\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad \\textrm{expand tensor}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\mu B^\\nu\\tilde{e}^\\alpha(\\vec{e}_\\mu)\\tilde{e}^\\beta(\\vec{e}_\\nu), \\qquad \\textrm{linearity of one-forms}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\mu B^\\nu\\delta^\\alpha_\\mu\\delta^\\beta_\\nu, \\qquad\\qquad\\quad~~ \\textrm{biorthonormality}\\\\\n    &= T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\alpha B^\\beta.\n\\end{align}\n\\] The final answer is a proper contraction of lower and upper indices which tells us that \\(T_{\\alpha\\beta}A^\\alpha B^\\beta\\) is a Lorentz scalar according to our index rules. This is reassuring since \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B})\\) is a geometrical quantity based on abstract objects with no reference to any particular reference frame.\nSo how do the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) transform between inertial frames? Since it has two lower indices we can guess immediately that it must be \\[\n    T_{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^\\alpha_\\bar{\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_\\bar{\\nu}T_{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\tag{6.1}\\] You are now invited to show that if this is true it guarantees that \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B})\\) is a Lorentz scalar.\nThe analogous reasoning applies to a type \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\) tensor which is a linear functional on two one-forms \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\tilde{Q}\\in\\mathcal{M}^*,\\tilde{P}\\in\\mathcal{M}^* \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nIts components are found by acting it on basis one-forms for each of the vector spaces \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) it acts on as \\[\n    T^{\\alpha\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha,\\tilde{e}^\\beta),\n\\] which then reconstruct it as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = T^{\\alpha\\beta}\\,\\vec{e}_\\alpha\\otimes\\vec{e}_\\beta.\n\\] Acting \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on two one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\) then gives \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P}) = T^{\\alpha\\beta}Q_\\alpha P_\\beta,\n\\] and this is a Lorentz scalar since the tensor components transform as \\[\n    T^{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\alpha\\Lambda^{\\bar{\\nu}}_\\beta T^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\] This leaves the final possible rank 2 tensor of type \\(({1 \\atop 1})\\) tensor which is a linear functional of one one-form and one 4-vector \\[\n\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}:\\tilde{Q}\\in\\mathcal{M}^*,\\tilde{P}\\in\\mathcal{M}^* \\mapsto a \\in \\mathbb{R},\n\\] and is depicted like this\nIt is a matter of convention opting to list the one-form first and the 4-vector second. The components of a type \\(({1 \\atop 1})\\) tensor are found by acting it on a basis one-form in \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and basis 4-vector in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) as \\[\n    {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta} = \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha,\\vec{e}_\\beta).\n\\] An immediate question is why we don’t write the components as \\(T^\\alpha_{\\beta}\\) or \\(T^{~~\\alpha}_{\\beta}\\). In this current context there is no ambiguity about what the indices refer to so any of these forms can be used. However, issues can arise when we start manipulating indices as we will discuss shortly.\nWe can reconstruct the tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}} = {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta}\\,\\vec{e}_\\alpha\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\beta,\n\\] and acting \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) on a one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and a 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) then gives \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{T}}(\\tilde{Q},\\vec{A}) = {T^{\\alpha}}_{\\beta}Q_\\alpha A^\\beta.\n\\] This is a Lorentz scalar since the tensor components transform as \\[\n    {T^{\\bar{\\mu}}}_{\\bar{\\nu}} = \\Lambda^{\\bar{\\mu}}_\\alpha\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar{\\nu}} {T^\\alpha}_\\beta.\n\\] Having fully specified rank 2 tensors we should now consider an example of one crucial to special relativity.",

    "text": "6.2 The metric tensor\nWe have already encountered a type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\)-tensor in Scalar-product and one-forms in the form of the scalar-product which endows our vector space \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) with concepts of length and orhtogonality. As a nod the general relativity course next year, we will denote the abstract geometrical tensor as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\). Formally this tensor is defined as one taking two input 4-vectors \\(\\vec{A}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) and returns their scalar-product as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) = g_{\\mu\\nu}A^\\mu B^\\nu = \\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B}.\n\\] From this expression we can immediately identify its components as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\mu,\\vec{e}_\\nu) = g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] as being equal to the Minkowski metric described in Introducing 4-vectors.  Consequently, the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) transform as \\[\n    g_{\\bar\\mu\\bar\\nu} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar\\nu} g_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\bar\\mu}\\Lambda^\\beta_{\\bar\\nu} \\eta_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\eta_{\\bar\\mu\\bar\\nu},\n\\] and hence in flat space-time the metric has identical elements equal to the \\(\\eta\\) symbol in all inertial frames, as we saw in Scalar-product and one-forms. Since the scalar-product is symmetric so is the metric tensor as \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{A},\\vec{B}) = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{B},\\vec{A}) \\implies g_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\nu\\mu}.\n\\] The inverse metric tensor, denoted \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\), is a \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\)-type tensor defined to take two input one-forms \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) and \\(\\tilde{P}\\) and return their scalar-product \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{P}) = g^{\\mu\\nu}Q_\\mu P_\\nu = \\tilde{Q}\\cdot\\tilde{P}.\n\\] Hence it is also symmetric with elements \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{e}_\\mu,\\tilde{e}_\\nu) = g^{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] The metric and its inverse have identical components in every inertial frame. The reason we denote \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) as the inverse of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is that their components obey \\[\n    g^{\\mu\\alpha}g_{\\alpha\\nu} = g_{\\nu\\alpha}g^{\\alpha\\mu} = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu,\n\\] which converted into a matrix expressions give \\[\n    \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\mu\\alpha}[\\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\alpha\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\mu\\nu} = \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^3[\\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\nu\\alpha}[\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\alpha\\mu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\nu\\mu}.\n\\] However, we know that both \\(\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\) and \\(\\underline{\\underline g} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\), while \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}^{\\rm T} = \\underline{\\underline \\eta}^{-1}\\), and so \\(\\underline{\\underline \\eta}\\, \\underline{\\underline \\eta} = \\mathbb{1}\\) hence \\[\n    [\\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}]_{\\mu\\nu} = [\\underline{\\underline g}\\, \\underline{\\underline g}^{-1}]_{\\nu\\mu} = [\\mathbb{1}]_{\\mu\\nu},\n\\] as required for an inverse. This property is crucial for a key use of the metric we now introduce.In this course we will always assume space-time is flat so \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) always has components \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\). However, in general relativity the components of \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) are functions of space-time which deviate from \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and whose behaviour encodes the curvature of the space-time.",

    "text": "6.3 Raising and lowering indices\nArmed with the metric tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) and its inverse \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) we can convert 4-vectors into one-forms and vice versa. Suppose we took a 4-vector \\(\\vec{V}\\) and inserted it into the first slot of the metric as \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\cdot)\\), but left the second slot free. Since \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is symmetric it doesn’t matter which slot we filled or left empty. What remains is a linear object which eats a 4-vector and returns a scalar, or in otherwords a one-form \\[\n    \\tilde{V} = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\cdot).\n\\] We have used the metric to make one-form version of \\(\\vec{V}\\). The components of this object follows as \\[\n    \\tilde{V}(\\vec{e}_\\mu) = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{V},\\vec{e}_\\mu) = V^\\nu\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\nu,\\vec{e}_\\mu) = V^\\nu\\eta_{\\nu\\mu} = V_\\mu.\n\\] Notationally we say we have lowered the index of \\(V^\\nu\\) to \\(V_\\mu\\) by using the metric. What this really means is that we contract \\(V^\\nu\\) with \\(\\eta_{\\nu\\mu}\\), so if we represent the components as a column vector then \\[\nV^\\nu = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  a \\\\\n  b \\\\\n  c \\\\\n  d\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\mapsto \\quad V_\\mu = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  a \\\\\n  -b \\\\\n  -c \\\\\n  -d\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] By construction the action on \\(\\tilde{V}\\) on any other 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}\\) is to return the scalar-product of it with \\(\\vec{V}\\) since \\[\n    \\tilde{V}(\\vec{A}) = V_\\mu A^\\mu = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}V^\\nu A^\\mu = \\vec{V}\\cdot\\vec{A}.\n\\]\nIn the same way we can use \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) to convert a one-form \\(\\tilde{Q}\\) into a 4-vector as \\[\n    \\vec{Q} = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{Q},\\cdot).\n\\] which has components \\[\n    \\vec{Q}(\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{Q},\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = Q_\\nu\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{e}^\\nu,\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = Q_\\nu\\eta^{\\nu\\mu},\n\\] suggesting we have now raised the index of \\(Q_\\nu\\) to \\(Q^\\mu\\) with \\(\\eta^{\\nu\\mu}\\) meaning \\[\nQ_\\nu = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  a \\\\\n  b \\\\\n  c \\\\\n  d\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\mapsto \\quad Q^\\mu = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  a \\\\\n  -b \\\\\n  -c \\\\\n  -d\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] We now see why we \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) is called the inverse metric since it reverses the index lowering performed by \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) as \\[\n    \\vec{V} = \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{V},\\cdot).\n\\] This is demonstrated by considering the components \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{V},\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = V_\\nu\\,\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}(\\tilde{e}^\\nu,\\tilde{e}^\\mu) = V^\\alpha\\eta_{\\alpha\\nu}\\eta^{\\nu\\mu} = V^\\alpha \\delta^\\mu_\\alpha = V^\\mu,\n\\] after using the identity \\(\\eta_{\\alpha\\nu}\\eta^{\\nu\\mu} = \\delta^\\mu_\\alpha\\).

Manipulating the metric tensor\nSolution …\n\n\n\nUsing the metric and its inverse to raise and lower indices is more than just an algebraic trick. Indeed one could envisage using any symmetric invertible type \\(({0 \\atop 2})\\) tensor \\(h_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and its inverse \\(h^{\\mu\\nu}\\) type \\(({2 \\atop 0})\\) tensor to define index raising and lowering. Formally all the above definitions could be applied with \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{h}}\\) instead. However, the Lorentz scalars resulting from contractions with \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{h}}\\) have no obvious physical meaning or significance. In contrast \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is central to the geometrical structure of space-time defining the scalar-product, so distances, time and angles, as well as its causal properties such as the light-cone and geodesics. As we shall see in the next lecture physical quantities of intrinsic interest arise from the scalar-product. So \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) is not just a invertible rank-2 tensor, it is a unique and privileged one with both geometrical and physical meaning. In the context of a flat space-time in special relativity we also have the added bonus that \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}\\) and \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) have the same fixed components in all inertial frames making index lowering and raising extremely straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a basis 4-vector to a one-form\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the basis 4-vectors and one-forms are related to each other through the biorthonormality relation \\[\n    \\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\nu) = \\delta^\\mu_\\nu.\n\\] So one might ask what one-form is generated by converting a basis 4-vector using the metric? We get \\[\n    \\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\cdot) = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde{e}^\\mu(\\vec{e}_\\alpha)\\otimes\\tilde{e}^\\nu = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^\\mu_\\alpha\\tilde{e}_\\nu = \\eta_{\\alpha\\nu}\\tilde{e}^\\nu.\n\\] The one-form \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_\\alpha,\\cdot)\\) is not simply \\(\\tilde{e}^\\alpha\\). Even with the simple flat space-time metric considered in this course there can be a sign difference, e.g. \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}(\\vec{e}_1,\\cdot) = -\\tilde{e}^1\\). In general relativity, where the metric can be non-diagonal, these two one-forms are completely different.",

Specifically, why can’t we just write the indices more compactly as \\[\n   {T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma} \\stackrel{?}{\\equiv} T^{\\alpha\\beta\\cdots\\gamma}_{\\mu\\nu\\cdots\\sigma}.  \n\\] The short answer is that you can, but you should be careful. As shown in figure above, the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) is taken to be acting on a tensor product of the \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The ordering matters since it indicates which of these spaces is being acted on. The compact form ensures that we can still identify the ordering of all upper and lower indices between themselves, but does not track the ordering between upper and lower indices. For the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) this is fine since upper and lower indices correspond to distinct types of vectors spaces making it unambigious what is meant.\nThe situation where care must be taken is when indices are lowered and raised thus inchanging upper and lower indices. Take the example of a type \\(({2 \\atop 1})\\) tensor with components \\(T^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\gamma\\) written compactly. The index \\(\\alpha\\) can be lowered as \\[\n    T^{\\beta}_{\\gamma\\mu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\alpha}T^{\\alpha\\beta}_\\gamma,\n\\] whereupon we need to make a choice about where to put the new lower index. Above we have used a convention of placing any new upper or lower index at the back. Now suppose we raise the \\(\\mu\\) index back up as \\[\n    T^{\\beta\\alpha}_{\\gamma} = \\eta^{\\alpha\\mu}T^{\\beta}_{\\gamma\\mu}.\n\\] Now the ordering of the upper indices is reversed. This is not a fatal problem but it could be potentially confusing.\nA way around this is to retain the full ordering of the tensor product by stacking upper and lower indices separately. Now no convention is required when lowering or raising and the ordering of indices is always unambiguous, e.g. \\[\n    {{T_{\\mu}}^{\\beta}}_{\\gamma} = \\eta_{\\mu\\alpha}{T^{\\alpha\\beta}}_\\gamma,\n\\] meaning the raising of the \\(\\mu\\) index recovers the original tensor \\[\n    {T^{\\alpha\\beta}}_{\\gamma} = \\eta^{\\alpha\\mu}{{T_{\\mu}}^{\\beta}}_{\\gamma}.\n\\] For clarity we will always use this full ordering of indices, but you may well see the more compact version in textbooks.",

    "text": "6.5 Physics is tensorial\nWe should remind ourselves why we have developed the formalism of tensors. Back in first lecture Principle of relativity we stated is that the laws of physics should not depend on what coordinate system or reference frame we choose to describe them in. Tensors are precisely the mathematical objects whose components transform in such a way that the relations between them remain invariant under any smooth change of coordinates. We can therefore make our principle of relativity from earlier more precise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of relativity (refined version)\n\n\n\nThe laws of physics should have a tensorial form because physical phenomena are geometric and coordinate-independent.\n\n\nThis means that we should construct or identify physical quantities in our theories as Lorentz scalars, 4-vectors, one-forms and tensors. Typically we may construct a tensor from other objects like \\[\n    {\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}} = n\\,\\vec{U}\\otimes\\vec{U} + p\\,\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1},\n\\] where \\(n,p\\) are Lorentz scalars, \\(\\vec{U}\\) is a 4-vector and \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{g}}^{-1}\\) is the inverse metric.  Often Lorentz scalars formed from the contraction these quantities, say like \\[\n    \\tilde{K}(\\vec{X}) \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad \\vec{P}\\cdot\\vec{X} \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad {\\pmb{\\symbb{W}}}(\\tilde{K},\\vec{P},\\vec{X}),\n\\] will play a central role, as we will see in the next lecture.In fact the tensor \\(\\pmb{\\symbb{T}}\\) here is the stress-energy tensor for dust which we will discuss briefly in a later lecture\nWhile it is essential that all these quantities are geometrical in practise when doing calculations we will work with an explicit representation in terms of components of some inertial frame, so we have \\[\n    K_\\mu X^\\mu \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}P^\\mu X^\\nu \\quad {\\rm or} \\quad {W^\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} K_\\mu P^\\alpha X^\\beta.\n\\] We can use the index formulation for all quantities, along with the appropriate rules for contraction and transformations, safe in the knowledge that we are faithfully describing the underlying abstract geometrical objects of the theory.

The motion of a particle in space and time then follows by solving Newton’s 2nd law which involves derivatives of \\({\\underline r}(t)\\) with \\(t\\) as \\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}^2}{{\\rm d}t^2}{\\underline r}(t) = {\\underline F}(t),\n\\] where \\({\\underline F}(t)\\) is the net force acting on the particle at any instance in time.\nFollowing this approach in special relativity would involve parameterising its space-time 4-vector \\(\\vec{X}\\) of the particle in some frame \\(S\\) by the time coordinate of that frame \\[\nX^\\mu(t) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct \\\\\n  x(t) \\\\\n  y(t) \\\\\n  z(t)\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  ct \\\\\n  {\\underline r}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] thereby describing its trajectory through space-time. Naturally, we will need to consider its derivates with respect to its parameter giving \\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}X^\\mu(t) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  c \\\\\n  \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}{\\underline r}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  c \\\\\n  {\\underline v}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] where \\({\\underline v}(t)\\) is the 3-velocity of the particle.\nThe problem with this formulation is that it is not relativistically covariant. This is because time \\(t\\) is a coordinate of this frame \\(S\\). Other inertial observers will have differing records of the time describing the motion of this particle. Consequently, despite its appearance the derivative \\(\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}X^\\mu(t)\\) is not a bonifide 4-vector since it does not transform between frames in the correct way.",

    "text": "7.2 Introducing the 4-velocity\nWe overcome this issue by instead using a time coordinate which behaves likes a Lorentz scalar. The clear choice is the proper time \\(s\\) of the particle itself. As we have discussed before, this acts like a Lorentz scalar since it is intrinsic to the system and is agreed upon by all observers. To see how this works take a point on the world \\(X^\\mu(t)\\) and another point \\(X^\\mu(t+\\delta t)\\). For \\(c\\delta t \\ll 1\\) we know that \\[\n    X^\\mu(t+\\delta t) = X^\\mu(t) + \\overbrace{\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}X^\\mu(t)\\,\\delta t}^{\\delta X^\\mu(t)} + \\cdots.\n\\] So while \\(\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}X^\\mu(t)\\) is not a 4-vector, \\(\\delta X^\\mu(t) = \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}t}X^\\mu(t)\\delta t\\) is since it connects the two space-time points on the world-line and is a geometrical object.\n\n\n\nA relativistically covariant way of parameterising a world-line is to use the proper time \\(s\\) of the particle itself. Formally \\(s\\) is the \\(c \\times\\) time coordinate of the MCRF of the particle, e.g. the one where it appears at rest at any instance. For a general motion of a particle this frame changes with \\(s\\).\n\n\nWe now compute the length of \\(\\delta X^\\mu(t)\\) as \\[\n  \\delta X^\\mu(t)\\delta X_\\mu(t) = \\delta s^2 = (c\\delta t)^2 - (v \\delta t)^2 = (c\\delta t)^2\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right),\n\\] where \\(v = \\sqrt{{\\underline v}\\cdot{\\underline v}}\\) is the speed of the particle at \\(X^\\mu(t)\\) relative to frame \\(S\\). In the limit \\(\\delta t \\rightarrow 0\\) we have \\[\n  \\frac{{\\rm d}s}{{\\rm d}(ct)} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma(\\beta)},\n\\] recalling that \\(\\beta = v/c\\). This indicates to us that a time-interval \\(c\\delta t\\) is \\(\\gamma(\\beta)\\) longer than the interval \\(\\delta s\\). Using this we can now compute the derivative of \\(X^\\mu(t)\\) with respects to \\(s\\) rather than \\(t\\) as \\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}s}X^\\mu(s) = \\frac{{\\rm d}(ct)}{{\\rm d}s} \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}(ct)}X^\\mu(t) = \\gamma(\\beta) \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1 \\\\\n  {\\underline v}(t)/c\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] This derivative is a bonifide 4-vector since \\(s\\) does not transform between frames. It defines a key kinematic quantity called the 4-velocity \\(\\vec{U}\\) \\[\n  U^\\mu(s) = \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}s}X^\\mu(s),\n\\] which is the tangent to the world-line \\(X^\\mu(s)\\) and hence geometrical. Notice also that the 4-velocity, despite its name, is a dimensionless quantity.\nSince our particle is travelling with a speed \\(v&lt;c\\), then we always have \\(\\delta s &gt; 0\\) (so it is time-like). This means that in the momentarily comoving reference frame (MCRF) of the particle the \\(c\\bar{t}\\)-axis of this frame is by construction the instantaneous tangent to world-line of the particle.\n\n\n\nIn the MCRF of the particle, \\(\\bar S\\), the \\(c{\\bar t}\\) axis is tangent to the world-line of the particle (possible because the particle’s motion is time-like). The 4-velocity in this frame is thus just the \\(c{\\bar t}\\) coordinate.\n\n\nThis means that the space-time position 4-vector of the particle for small intervals around the chosen instance is very simple in this frame \\[\n    X^{\\bar \\mu}(s) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  s \\\\\n  {\\underline 0}\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] hence the 4-velocity in this frame is just \\[\n\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}s}X^{\\bar \\mu}(s) = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1 \\\\\n  {\\underline 0}\n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Notice that even it is rest-frame the particle has a non-zero 4-velocity! We are free to use the MCRF \\(\\bar S\\) in which to compute the length of \\(\\vec{U}\\) as \\[\n    \\vec{U}\\cdot\\vec{U} = U^{\\bar \\mu}(s)U_{\\bar \\mu}(s) = 1.\n\\] The 4-velocity \\(\\vec{U}\\) has a unit length and this is a Lorentz scalar geometrical quantity, so it must be true in all frames. So we must get the same result from our original frame \\(S\\) where \\[\nU^\\mu(s)= \\gamma(\\beta) \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1 \\\\\n  {\\underline v}(s)/c\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\tag{7.1}\\] which gives \\[\n    \\vec{U}\\cdot\\vec{U} = U^{\\mu}(s)U_{\\mu}(s) = \\gamma(\\beta)^2(1-\\beta^2) = 1,\n\\] as expected. We can also sanity check what we get if we Lorentz transform \\(\\vec{U}\\) from \\(\\bar S\\) back to frame \\(S\\) as \\[\n    U^\\mu(s) = \\Lambda^\\mu_{\\bar \\nu} U^{\\bar \\nu}(s),\n\\] which, assuming frame \\(S\\) is moving \\({\\underline v} = -v{\\underline e}_1\\) relative to the particle, gives \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  \\gamma(\\beta) & \\gamma(\\beta)\\beta & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  \\gamma(\\beta)\\beta & \\gamma(\\beta) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1\\\\\n  0\\\\\n  0\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\\right) = \\gamma(\\beta)\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  1\\\\\n  \\beta\\\\\n  0\\\\\n  0  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Assuming a general velocity \\({\\underline v}\\) gives Equation 7.1. We have thus established the 4-velocity is a sensible 4-vector with unit length.",

In relativistic mechanics these are not useful quantities to build our description around since they are not relativistically covariant. We need 4-vectors not 3-vectors. For this reason we instead use the 4-velocity \\(\\vec{U}\\) and construct a 4-momentum from it as \\[\n  \\vec{P} = mc\\,\\vec{U}.\n\\] We multiply \\(\\vec{U}\\) by \\(c\\) so it has the units of velocity, and then by mass \\(m\\) of the particle to give units of momentum. Both these quantities are Lorentz scalars and so do not effect the transformation properties of \\(\\vec{U}\\), meaning \\(\\vec{P}\\) is a valid 4-vector. It is instructive to examine its components \\[\nP^\\mu=  \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\gamma m c \\\\\n  \\gamma {\\underline v}\n\\end{array}\\right), = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\mathcal{E}/c \\\\\n  {\\underline p}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{7.2}\\] where we see that the time-component \\(P^0\\) is related to the relativistic energy \\(\\mathcal{E} = \\gamma mc^2\\), while the spatial components are the relativistic 3-momentum \\({\\underline p} = \\gamma m {\\underline v}\\) familiar from 2nd year special relativity.\nIt is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on \\(\\vec{P}\\). We have conjured up the key quantities of relativistic kinematics \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) and \\(\\underline p\\) by using just 4-velocity \\(\\vec{U}\\), which is itself just the tangent of the particle’s world-line. We know that \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) and \\(\\underline p\\) change from frame to frame, however the 4-momentum \\(\\vec{P}\\) constructed bundles them together into a bonifide 4-vector such that the transformation of these quantities between frames is now compactly captured by a Lorentz transformation \\[\n    P^{\\bar \\nu} = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\mu P^\\mu.\n\\] This is highly elegant. Yet, there is more beauty to come if we compute the length of \\(\\vec{P}\\) as \\[\n    P^\\mu P_\\mu = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}^2}{c^2} - {\\underline p}\\cdot {\\underline p}.\n\\] However, equally we have that \\[\n    P^\\mu P_\\mu = m^2c^2 U^\\mu U_\\mu = (mc)^2\n\\] hence, the fixed unit length of \\(\\vec{U}\\) means that \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathcal{E}^2}{c^2} - p^2 = (mc)^2,\n\\] or after rearranging \\[\n   \\mathcal{E}^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4.\n\\] The length of the 4-momentum is also fixed by \\((mc)^2\\) and the implication of this geometrical fact is the classic relativistic energy-momentum relation!",

Geometrically, the 4-acceleration is a curvature vector of the particle’s world-line. The world-line of an inertial observer by definition has zero 4-acceleration and hence is straight time-like line. Likewise we can define the 4-force as the rate of change of the 4-momentum \\[\n    \\vec{F} = c\\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}s}\\vec{P},\n\\] again with a factor of \\(c\\) for units. Given these two quantities one might wonder if Newton’s second law applies. Indeed, \\[\n    \\vec{F} = m\\vec{A},\n\\] does apply, but the content of this equation is not Newton’s 2nd law due to the 4-vector nature of the quantities.

    "text": "8.1 Plane-wave scalar fields\nEarlier in the Scalar-product and one-forms lecture we introduced a scalar field as a general Lorentz scalar functional of points in space-time \\(\\tilde{\\varphi}(\\vec{X})\\) which in a given frame \\(S\\) is a function \\(\\varphi(x)\\).\nThe requirement for \\(\\varphi(x)\\) to be Lorentz scalar places restrictions on the form of the field. For example, if \\(\\varphi(x)\\) depended only on the space-time coordinates \\(x^\\mu\\) in \\(S\\) and nothing else, then it must be of the form \\[\n\\varphi(x) = f(x_\\mu x^\\mu),\n\\] where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is an arbitrary function, itself parameterised by Lorentz scalars coefficients. The reason for this is that the only Lorentz scalar we can form from \\(x^\\mu\\) is the squared space-time interval \\(\\vec{X}\\cdot\\vec{X} = x_\\mu x^\\mu\\).\nMore interesting cases arise when \\(\\varphi(x)\\) is parameterised by additional covariant objects. Suppose \\(\\varphi(x)\\) was defined by another 4-vector \\(\\vec{Q}\\) with components \\(q^\\mu\\) in \\(S\\). In this case we can construct three Lorentz scalars \\(\\vec{X}\\cdot\\vec{Q}\\), \\(\\vec{X}\\cdot\\vec{X}\\) and \\(\\vec{Q}\\cdot\\vec{Q}\\) so in general \\(\\varphi(x)\\) has a dependence \\[\n\\varphi(x) = f(x_\\mu q^\\mu, x_\\mu x^\\mu, q_\\mu q^\\mu),\n\\] where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is now an arbitrary 3-variable function.\nWe already know a form of field with this dependence – plane waves travelling with a wave speed of \\(c\\). They have the general form \\[\n    \\varphi(ct,{\\underline r}) = a\\, e^{i(\\omega t - {\\underline k}\\cdot{\\underline r})},\n\\] where \\(a\\) is a Lorentz scalar amplitude, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency and \\(\\underline k\\) is the 3-wave-vector of the wave. If this plane-wave is to be a Lorentz scalar field then we need that the phase of the wave \\[\n    \\theta(x) = \\omega t - {\\underline k}\\cdot{\\underline r},\n\\] is a Lorentz scalar. Specifically, all inertial observers must agree on the value of the phase at a given point in space-time. The reason for this is that the “event” that the wave reached it maximum extent, or has a node, is something every observer can agree on. They won’t agree on the coordinates ascribed to this event, or the time elapsed and distance between pairs of such events, but they will agree that one occured a given point.\nThis tells us that \\(\\theta(x)\\) must be a scalar-product between \\(\\vec{X}\\) and another 4-vector. Or in otherwords we can the scalar \\(\\omega\\) and 3-vector \\(\\underline k\\) into a 4-wave-vector \\(\\vec{K}\\) with components in some frame \\(S\\) as \\[\nk^\\mu = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\omega/c \\\\\n{\\underline k} \\end{array}\\right).\n\\] This sensibly links \\(\\omega\\) with the time component, and \\(\\underline k\\) with the spatial components. Naturally both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\underline k\\) for a given wave differ between inertial frames as described by a standard Lorentz transformation \\[\nk^{\\bar \\nu} = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\mu k^\\mu.\n\\] This indicates that transforming between inertial frames mixes \\(\\omega\\) and components of \\(\\underline k\\). Using \\(\\vec{K}\\) we can express a plane-wave in a covariant form \\[\n    \\varphi(x) = a\\, e^{i k_\\mu x^\\mu},\n\\] recalling that \\[\nk_\\mu = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\omega/c \\\\\n-{\\underline k} \\end{array}\\right),\n\\] so the scalar-product of the 4-wave-vector and the space-time 4-vector is \\[\n    k_\\mu x^\\mu = (\\omega/c)ct - {\\underline k}\\cdot{\\underline r}.\n\\] Consequently, the phase factor of the plane-wave is a Lorentz invariant, e.g. a Lorentz scalar linear functional, with the plane-wave itself given by its complex exponential \\[\n    \\tilde{\\varphi}(\\vec{X})  = a\\, e^{i \\vec{K}\\cdot\\vec{X}},\n\\] making explicit that it is also a Lorentz scalar (non-linear) functional of space-time \\(\\vec{X}\\). We characterise the type of plane-wave by the Lorentz scalar \\(\\vec{K}\\cdot\\vec{K}\\) which is \\[\n    \\vec{K}\\cdot\\vec{K} = k_\\mu k^\\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 - {\\underline k}\\cdot{\\underline k}.\n\\] If \\(k_\\mu k^\\mu &gt; 0\\) it tell us \\(\\vec{K}\\) is time-like, if \\(k_\\mu k^\\mu = 0\\) then it is light-like, or if \\(k_\\mu k^\\mu &lt; 0\\) it is space-like.",

The solutions are plane-waves. In a given frame \\(S\\) let’s carefully compute the derivative of the plane-wave starting with the expression \\[\n    \\partial_\\mu e^{i \\theta(x)} = \\partial_\\mu \\theta(x) \\, \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}\\theta(x)} e^{i\\theta(x)} =  ie^{i\\theta(x)} \\partial_\\mu \\theta(x)\n\\] so using the phase \\(\\theta(x) = k_\\nu x^\\nu\\) we get \\[\n    \\partial_\\mu e^{i k_\\nu x^\\nu} = ik_\\nu\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu} x^\\nu\\right)e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma} = ik_\\nu \\delta^\\nu_\\mu e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma} = ik_\\mu e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma}.\n\\] Similarly, since \\(k_\\nu x^\\nu = k^\\nu x_\\nu\\) (index see-sawing) we have \\[\n    \\partial^\\mu e^{i k_\\nu x^\\nu} = ik^\\nu\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_\\mu} x_\\nu\\right)e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma} = ik^\\nu \\delta_\\nu^\\mu e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma} = ik^\\mu e^{i k_\\sigma x^\\sigma}.\n\\] Putting this together we get \\[\n    \\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu \\varphi(x) = (ik^\\mu)(ik_\\mu)\\varphi(x) = -k_\\mu k^\\mu \\varphi(x) = 0.\n\\] Given the plane-wave \\(\\varphi(x) \\neq 0\\) unless its amplitude \\(a = 0\\) it can only be a general solution to the wave-equation if \\(k_\\mu k^\\mu = 0\\). Hence the 4-wave-vector must be a lightlike 4-vector.\nThis implies that the wave solutions to the wave-equation are controlled by the dispersion relation \\[\n    k_\\mu k^\\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 - \\underline{k}\\cdot\\underline{k} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 - |\\underline{k}|^2 = 0,\n\\tag{8.3}\\] or more compactly \\[\n    \\omega = \\pm c|\\underline{k}|.\n\\] If we applied the Einstein-Planck relation \\(\\mathcal{E} = \\hbar\\omega\\) and the de-Broglie relation \\(\\underline{p} = \\hbar\\underline{k}\\) embodying wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics then we see that the dispersion relation Equation 8.3 becomes \\(\\mathcal{E}^2 = p^2c^2\\). This is the relativistic energy-momentum relation for a massless particle and consistent with the fact that plane-wave solutions of the wave-equation have a wave speed of \\(c\\).\nConsider the modified wave-equation \\[\n    \\left(\\partial_\\nu\\partial^\\nu + \\alpha\\right)\\varphi(x) = 0,\n\\tag{8.4}\\] where \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) is a Lorentz scalar. Inserting a plane-wave into Equation 8.4 now gives \\[\n     \\left(-k_\\mu k^\\mu + \\alpha\\right)\\varphi(x) = 0.\n\\] and so plane-wave solutions require that \\(k_\\mu k^\\mu = \\alpha &gt; 0\\), meaning they have time-like 4-wave-vector. Identifying \\(\\alpha = m^2c^2/\\hbar^2\\) makes Equation 8.4 the Klein-Gordon equation describing particle with mass \\(m&gt;0\\). The dispersion relation then becomes \\[\n  (\\hbar\\omega)^2 = |\\hbar\\underline{k}|^2c^2 + m^2c^4, \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathcal{E}^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4,\n\\tag{8.5}\\] and hence obeys the relativistic energy-momentum relation for a massive particle.  It is worth contrasting that plane-waves with space-like 4-wave-vectors are not solutions to any causal, stable relativistic wave equation. They do not describe propagating waves and instead arise as solutions of Poisson type equations.We will briefly consider quantum wave-equations at the end of this course (non-examinable). One issue which is apparent here already is that \\(\\mathcal{E} = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}\\) admits both positive and negative solutions. This is no issue for an angular frequency of a classical wave but once ascribed to the energy of a particle serious problems arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "8.3 Field describing a fluid\nFields don’t have to be Lorentz scalar, they can be any covariant object such as a 4-vector \\(\\vec{A}(\\vec{X})\\) or tensor \\({\\boldsymbol T}(\\vec{X})\\). The field is now described by components in a given frame, e.g. \\(A^\\mu(x)\\) or \\(T^{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\), and their value at any given point in space-time does not have to be agreed upon by all observers. Instead the components of the field should transform appropriately between frames as \\[\n    A^{\\bar \\mu}({\\bar x}) = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_\\nu A^\\nu(x), \\quad T^{\\bar{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}}({\\bar x}) = \\Lambda^{\\bar \\mu}_\\sigma \\Lambda^{\\bar \\nu}_\\kappa T^{\\sigma\\kappa}(x).\n\\] An inituitive example of a 4-vector field is to imagine space is filled with a continuous fluid of particles and \\(\\vec{U}(\\vec{X})\\) represents the 4-velocity of all particles inside an infinitesmal volume around the point \\(\\vec{X}\\). Being a 4-velocity means that it obeys \\[\n    \\vec{U}(\\vec{X})\\cdot\\vec{U}(\\vec{X}) = 1, \\quad \\forall \\vec{X}.\n\\] In 1+2D space-time we can imagine there is a strained spaghetti of worldlines (strained so they are not tangled up) which varies smoothly across space and time. The 4-velocity field \\(\\vec{U}(\\vec{X})\\) is then the tangent to the worldline at a given point as shown here:\n\n\n\nA strained spaghetti of worldlines varying smoothly through 1+2D space-time depicting the trajectory of a continuous fluid of particles in frame \\(S\\). A small ``volume” element \\(\\delta V = \\delta x\\delta y\\) at point \\(\\vec{X}\\) is shown. The zoomed-in plot shows the worldlines of 6 particles inside \\(\\delta V\\) which necessarily possess the same 4-velocity. Here is depicts negative motion along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n\nThe picture shows a small “volume” element for 2D \\(\\delta V = \\delta x\\delta y\\) at a point \\(\\vec{X}\\). Since \\(U(\\vec{X})\\) varies smoothly all the particles (six drawn) inside the volume element at \\(\\vec{X}\\) necessarily have the same 4-velocity. In general for frame \\(S\\) this 4-velocity will describe particles moving through space and time. Since the particles are massive the 4-velocity is time-like and so there exists another frame \\(\\bar S\\) in which it points along its \\(c\\bar t\\)-axis. This is the momentarily comoving reference frame for the particles at \\(\\vec{X}\\), so the particles in the volume element are now stationary, as shown here:\n\n\n\nThe volume element at \\(\\vec{X}\\) depicted in frame \\(\\bar S\\) where all the particles are stationary, so their 4-velocity points along the \\(c\\bar t\\)-axis. Viewing the volume element in \\(\\bar S\\) in frame \\(S\\) we see that it is titled by their relative motion along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n\nA volume element in a given frame is a small hypersurface of constant time in that frame. However, different inertial frames do not agree on the notion of simultaneity so the volume element \\(\\delta \\bar V\\) in \\(\\bar S\\) is not a hypersurface of constant time in frame \\(S\\). As shown above \\(\\delta \\bar V\\) viewed in frame \\(S\\) is tilted in the \\(ct\\) and \\(x\\) axes. So if we take \\(\\delta V\\) as the hypersurface of constant time swept out by \\(\\delta \\bar V\\) in frame \\(S\\) then it will experience length contraction so the volumes are related as \\[\n    \\delta x = \\frac{\\delta \\bar x}{\\gamma} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\delta V = \\frac{\\delta {\\bar x}\\delta {\\bar y}}{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\delta \\bar V}{\\gamma}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) connects frames \\(S\\) and \\(\\bar S\\) and using that \\(\\delta y = \\delta \\bar y\\), since the relative motion between the frames is along the \\(x\\)-axis. Hence the volume in any other frame \\(S\\) obeys \\(\\delta V &lt; \\delta \\bar V\\).\nNow suppose we have a certain number of particles \\(N\\) ( = 6 in the figure above) contained in the volume element \\(\\delta \\bar V\\) in the comoving frame \\(\\bar S\\). The number density of particles at \\(\\vec{X}\\) in frame \\(\\bar S\\) is then \\[\n    \\rho_0(\\vec{X}) = \\frac{N}{\\delta \\bar V}.\n\\] The following important observation applies:We can turn \\(\\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\) into a charge density by multiplying it by the electronic charge \\(e\\), or mass density by multiplying by the mass \\(m\\), both of which are Lorentz scalars.\n\n\\(\\Big(\\)# of particle in comoving frame’s \\(\\delta {\\bar V}\\)\\(\\Big)\\) = \\(\\Big(\\)# of particle in \\(\\delta V\\) of any other frame \\(\\Big)\\)\n\nThe reason for this is that the boundaries of the comoving volume \\(\\delta \\bar V\\) from frame \\(\\bar S\\) sweeping through space-time in \\(S\\) is, by construction, parallel to the worldlines of the particles contained within it. As such none will cross the boundary guaranteeing that all the particle worldlines will cross the hypersurface \\(\\delta V\\) in any frame \\(S\\). Consequently the density at \\(\\vec{X}\\) in frame \\(S\\) is \\[\n    \\rho(\\vec{X}) = \\frac{N}{\\delta V}, \\quad \\implies \\quad \\rho(\\vec{X}) = \\gamma\\rho_0(\\vec{X}),\n\\tag{8.6}\\]\nshowing that the density in any other frame \\(S\\) increases compared to the comoving frame \\(\\bar S\\). The density of particles \\(\\rho(\\vec{X})\\) is therefore not a Lorentz scalar, however the comoving density \\(\\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\) can be treated as such. Like the proper time it is a property that is intrinsic to the fluid itself. Therefore all observers of that system can determine and agree upon \\(\\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\) making it an effective Lorentz scalar since it does not transform between observers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Work-along exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Space-time volume elements\nSuppose in 3D Euclidean space we have a general curvilinear coordinate system comprising the variables \\(u_1,u_2,u_3\\) such that standard Cartesian coordinates are functions \\(x(u_1,u_2,u_3), y(u_1,u_2,u_3)\\) and \\(z(u_1,u_2,u_3)\\). The infinitesmal volume element in this space \\({\\rm d}V= {\\rm d}x{\\rm d}y{\\rm d}z\\) can be expressed in the new general coordinates system as \\[\n    {\\rm d}V = \\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u_1,u_2,u_3)}\\right|{\\rm d}u_1{\\rm d}u_2{\\rm d}u_3,\n\\] where the factor connecting them is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix \\[\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u_1,u_2,u_3)}\\right| = {\\rm det}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u_1}  & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u_2}  &  \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u_3} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_1}  & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_2}  & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_3}  \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u_1}  &  \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u_2} &   \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u_3}\n\\end{array}\n\\right].\n\\] In Minkowski space the space-time volume element is often written as \\({\\rm d}^4 x = c{\\rm d}t{\\rm d}x{\\rm d}y{\\rm d}z\\) in some frame \\(S\\).\n\nConsidering a Lorentz boost to a new frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) travelling at a speed \\(v\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis use the above to show that the space-time volume element is identical between inertial frames \\({\\rm d}^4 \\bar{x} = {\\rm d}^4 x\\).\nNow consider a space-time hypercube of finite size \\(L^4\\) in \\(S\\). Given \\(\\bar{y} = y\\) and \\(\\bar{z} = z\\) we know that the length of the cube along the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) axes are identical in both frames. What does the cube look like in frame \\(\\bar{S}\\) and what is its space-time volume?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Space-time volume elements\nSolution …",

    "text": "8.4 Particle current density and the continuity equation\nFor a non-relativistic fluid with density \\(\\rho({\\underline r},t)\\) and 3-velocity field \\({\\underline v}({\\underline r},t)\\) then we can form a 3-current density field as \\[\n    {\\underline j}({\\underline r},t) = \\rho({\\underline r},t)\\,{\\underline v}({\\underline r},t).\n\\] From this computing \\({\\underline j}({\\underline r},t)\\cdot d {\\underline A}\\) gives the flux of particles crossing an area \\(d {\\underline A}\\) per unit time. The relativistic generalisation of this quantity is the 4-current density \\[\n    \\vec{j}(\\vec{X}) = \\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\vec{U}({\\vec X})c.\n\\tag{8.7}\\] We have to include a factor of \\(c\\) to ensure the correct units since \\(\\vec{U}({\\vec X})\\) is dimensionless. Since \\(\\vec{j}(\\vec{X})\\) is constructed from Lorentz scalars multiplying a 4-vector field \\(\\vec{U}({\\vec X})\\) then it is also a genuine 4-vector field.\nEvaluating the 4-current density in the comoving frame \\(\\bar S\\) at \\(\\vec{X}\\) we get \\[\nj^{\\bar \\mu}(\\vec{X}) = \\rho_0(\\vec{X})c\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\\n0\\\\\n0\\\\\n0 \\end{array}\\right),\n\\] Since frame \\(S\\) is travelling \\({\\underline v}(\\vec{X})\\) relative to \\(\\bar S\\) then we can write the 4-current density in \\(S\\) as \\[\nj^{\\bar \\mu}(\\vec{X}) = \\rho_0(\\vec{X})c\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\gamma \\\\\n\\gamma{\\underline v}(\\vec{X})/c\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\gamma \\rho_0(\\vec{X})c \\\\\n\\gamma \\rho_0(\\vec{X}){\\underline v}(\\vec{X})\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\rho(\\vec{X})c \\\\\n\\rho(\\vec{X}){\\underline v}(\\vec{X})\\end{array}\\right),\n\\] after identifying the density \\(\\rho(\\vec{X})\\) in frame \\(S\\).

This means that any frame \\(S\\) the flux of particles into and out of the frame’s volume element \\(\\delta V\\) described by \\({\\underline j}({\\underline r},t)\\) controls the rate of change of density \\(\\rho({\\underline r},t)\\) in that volume.\n\n\n\nThe density \\(\\rho(\\vec{X})\\) inside the volume element \\(\\delta V\\) at \\(\\vec{X}\\) depicted here for 1+3D space-time can only change if the 3-current density \\({\\underline j}(\\vec{X})\\) has a non-zero flux across the boundaries of the volume.\n\n\nThis conservation is described by the continuity equation \\[\n    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\rho({\\underline r},t) + \\nabla \\cdot {\\underline j}({\\underline r},t) = 0,\n\\tag{8.9}\\] familiar from electromagnetism. This equation has a very elegant relativistic form. Using Equation 8.1 and Equation 8.8 then Equation 8.9 reduces to \\[\n    \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu(\\vec{X}) = 0.\n\\] Whenever the 4-current field \\(j^\\mu(\\vec{X})\\) describes the flow of a conserved quantity then it will have zero 4-divergence.

Writing this in terms of the comoving density using Equation 8.6 then gives \\(\\mathcal{E}(\\vec{X}) = \\gamma^2 mc^2\\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\delta V\\). Crucially, we see that it has a factor of \\(\\gamma^2\\), one from the relativistic energy and one from the density enhancement by length contraction. No 4-vector quantity can ever acquire a factor of \\(\\gamma^2\\) via a Lorentz transformation.\nWhat this observation tells us is that energy density must instead be a component of a rank-2 tensor field. This is the stress-energy tensor \\(\\boldsymbol{T}(\\vec{X})\\). To finish up let’s consider the simplest possible example – the stress-energy tensor of “dust” given by \\[\n    \\boldsymbol{T}_{\\rm dust}(\\vec{X}) = mc^2\\rho_0(\\vec{X})\\vec{U}({\\vec X})\\otimes\\vec{U}({\\vec X}).  \n\\] In a general frame \\(S\\) it has components \\[\n    T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm dust}(\\vec{X}) = mc^2\\rho_0(\\vec{X})U^\\mu({\\vec X})U^\\nu({\\vec X}),  \n\\]\nwhich in the comoving frame \\(\\bar S\\) gives a very simple form \\[\nT^{{\\bar \\mu}{\\bar \\nu}}_{\\rm dust}(\\vec{X}) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} mc^2\\rho_0(\\vec{X}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0& 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right),\n\\tag{8.10}\\] with the energy density as the time-time component \\(T^{00}\\).

    "text": "It feels like we have come a long way since the first lecture about special relativity. Let’s try to summarise the main steps we have made, before looking at how these ideas get generalized in further theories.\n\nOverview\nIn Part I, we considered how to write down expressions that are Lorentz invariant (for scalars), or covariant, taking on the same form in all inertial reference frames, following the principle of relativity, namely that all inertial frames should be equivalent for the formulation of physical laws. Following the invariance of the spacetime interval between two events, we developed our notion of 4-vectors and one-forms, whose components keep track of minus signs, based on the Minkowski metric \\(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}.\\) We recognised that relativistic energy and momentum are related as the 4-momentum \\(P^{\\mu},\\) and that fields are continuous functions of spacetime, such as 4-velocity fields and 4-currents. The 4-momentum flux of a matter field is given by the symmetric, rank 2 stress energy tensor \\(T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\mathrm{matter}}.\\)\nIn Part II, we saw that the Lagrangian \\(L\\) for a classical mechanical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom can be generalized to continuously many degrees of freedom, via a Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L},\\) whose Euler-Lagrange equation is a PDE, involving space and time derivatives on an equal footing. In fact, if \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a Lorentz scalar, the Euler-Lagrange equation, on varying invariant or covariant field quantities, is itself relativistically covariant, automatically giving covariant field equations. This involves the divergence theorem in four dimensional spacetime, and the full solution of a problem requires specifying boundary conditions on a four-dimensional spacetime volume \\(\\Omega.\\)\nThe d’Alembert equation (with wave speed \\(c\\)) is the simplest relativistic wave equation, and this in principle can be solved using Fourier methods with appropriate boundary conditions, and we identify the Fourier representation as a relativistic plane wave superposition. More complicated Lagrangians involve source terms (leading to inhomogeneous field equations), or higher-than-quadratic field combinations (leading to nonlinear equations).\nWe realized that conservation laws for fields correspond to finding 4-currents which are divergenceless, and proved Noether’s theorem which finds such currents based on symmetry of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) under some continuous symmetry of ‘field space’. Separately, in the problems class, we saw that a similar argument makes the stress-energy tensor divergenceless when the field sees, through its Lagrangian, Minkowski spacetime as homogeneous.\nIn Part III, we saw how Maxwell’s equations could be put into a covariant form by realizing the components of \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) are components of the rank 2 antisymmetric Faraday tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu},\\) and that there are two relativistic Maxwell equations. \\(V\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) are naturally components of the 4-potential \\(A^{\\mu},\\) and electromagnetism can naturally be put into the Lagrangian framework if the varied field is the 4-potential itself. However, we do not have a full, fundamental Lagrangian approach to electrodynamics without a field theory for matter, which motivated us to consider relativistic quantum mechanics.\nIn Part IV, we saw that a way of constructing quantum mechanical matter field equations was to equate the action of the energy operator on a (relativistic) wavefunction with a relativistic expression for the energy in terms of the momentum operator acting on the wavefunction. We also noticed that the continuity of probability density is a conservation law related to the noetherian symmetry of global gauge (phase) invariance of the wavefunction, and, when the quantum particle is charged, interactions with the electromagnetic field imply that gauge transformations of the electromagnetic potentials are related to a local gauge symmetry on the wavefunction.\nWe first considered the Klein-Gordon equation, which is like the d’Alembert equation with an extra term proportional to the particle’s Compton wavenumber squared times the wavefunction. Although the KG equation has many desirable features for a relativistic quantum wave equation, we rejected it due to its being second order in time (so we cannot propagate it only knowing the initial wavefunction), and that the current arising from gauge transformations has a possibly negative density where we would expect to see a nonnegative probability density.\nThis led to us to consider Dirac’s approach of a multicomponent wavefunction, which in turn led to the definition of the Dirac equation in both Hamiltonian and relativistically covariant forms. Gauge transformations of the Dirac equation (involving the 4-component Dirac spinor \\(\\psi\\) and its adjoint \\(\\overline{\\psi}\\)) indeed now lead to a divergenceless 4-current whose 0-component is now positive definite. We saw how Dirac proposed to resolve the paradox of negative energy states (which have their own plane wave solutions) with the idea of a ‘sea’ of filled negative energy states; now we interpret these negative energy states as related to antimatter (although we have not discussed how). When interactions are included, the Dirac equation, in the nonrelativistic limit, becomes the Pauli equation, and we concluded by writing down a Lagrangian which encompasses charged matter and the electromagnetic field, coupled by an interaction term, based on the Lorentz force Lagrangian involving the electromagnetic 4-potential and the Dirac 4-current.\nWe now outline how many of these concepts generalize and are utilized in further fundamental theories of contemporary physics.\n\n\nFurther Special Relativity\nThe linear relativistic field equations we derived and discussed in the course can be put into the table below, depending on whether they include a mass or are massless, and according to their spin (i.e. the number of independent field components), ignoring interactions.\n\n\n\nspin\nmassless equation\nmassive equation\n\n\n\n\n0\nd’Alembert equation\nKlein-Gordon equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\square^2\\varphi = 0\\)\n\\(\\square^2\\varphi + \\left(\\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 \\varphi = 0\\)\n\n\n1/2\nmassless Dirac (‘neutrino’/Weyl) equation\nDirac equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu} \\psi = 0\\)\n\\(\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu} \\psi + {\\rm i} \\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar} \\psi = 0\\)\n\n\n1\nMaxwell equation (homogeneous)\nHomogeneous Proca equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_{\\mu} F^{\\mu\\nu} = 0\\)\n\\(\\partial_{\\mu} F^{\\mu\\nu} + \\left(\\tfrac{m c}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 A^{\\nu} = 0\\)\n\n\n3/2\nmassless Rarita-Schwinger equation\nmassive Rarita-Schwinger equation\n\n\n\n\\(\\gamma_{\\nu} \\partial_{\\rho} \\psi_{\\sigma} + \\gamma_{\\rho} \\partial_{\\sigma} \\psi_{\\nu} + \\gamma_{\\sigma} \\partial_{\\nu} \\psi_{\\rho} = 0\\)\n\\(\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\gamma^5 \\gamma_{\\nu} \\partial_{\\rho} \\psi_{\\sigma} + \\tfrac{m c}{2\\hbar}[\\gamma^{\\mu},\\gamma^{\\nu}] \\psi_{\\nu} = 0\\)\n\n\n\nIn fact, if we were to continue, we would see the (empty space) Einstein equation for general relativity in the massless spin 2 slot, and the inhomogeneous form as the full Einstein field equation. Feynman, in the Feynman Lectures on Gravitation, shows how it is in principle possible to build up a classical field theory using symmetry arguments to show the relevant field is a massless, traceless symmetric rank 2 tensor (i.e. spin 2), and then forcing the resulting Lagrangian to be gauge invariant; the connection with the curvature of space is only made after the field equations are written down.\nIn fact, these field equations follow from the mathematical structure of the Poincaré group of all Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. Using the representation theory of this group as matrices, Bargmann and Wigner (Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 34 (1948) 211-23) showed that each of the group’s ‘irreducible representations’ are labelled by a continuous parameter (the mass \\(m\\)) and a discrete parameter (the spin), and there is a unique relativistic wave equation for each pair. For massive particles in their rest frame, the spin is equivalent to that of a nonrelativistic particle, and there are the same number of independent components. For massless ‘particles’ with null 4-momentum, however, the set of relevant Lorentz transformations keeping the state fixed is equivalent to the 2-dimensional euclidean group (i.e. 2D rotations and translations), which leads to the restriction to only two spin states, parallel and antiparallel to the corresponding null vector: this accounts for why plane waves corresponding to massless fields (EM, gravity) are transverse to their direction of propagation.\nOne encounters particular difficulties in trying to derive a sensible physical interpretation from solutions of equations for massive particles when the spin gets high, beginning with the Rarita-Schwinger equation (introduced in Phys Rev 60 (1941) 61). As argued by Velo and Zwanziger (Phys Rev 186 (1969) 1137-41; 188 (1969) 2218-22), the wavefronts of a charged RS field, and other massive spin \\(&gt; 1\\) fields, can propagate faster than \\(c,\\) in conflict with usual notions of causality. Thus matter fields appear to be mainly made up of Klein-Gordon, Proca and Dirac fields; in fact, the only fundamental massive particles in the standard model with spin 0 are Higgs bosons.… It turns out that other fundamental interactions, beyond EM and gravity, can be explained using multicomponent generalizations of the gauge transformation relationship between the EM potential and the phase of a wavefunction: the corresponding classical wave equations are nonlinear, ‘nonabelian’ (i.e. matrix-valued) Yang-Mills theories, as discussed below.\n\n\nGeneral Relativity\nEinstein’s original motivation for General Relativity was to widen the class of frames in which the formulation of physics is equivalent. Rather than only consider inertial frames, we now describe all frames of reference on spacetime – ‘general covariance’. Geometrically, this is equivalent to considering arbitrary curvilinear coordinates on spacetime, and the class of allowed transformations is widened to include any coordinate system. Each generalized frame/coordinate system is specified by a metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu},\\) which is now a tensor with respect to all coordinate transformations. In particular, \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is now typically a function of position (representing the changing nature of the coordinates), and the coordinate axes are typically oblique, leading to a more complicated relationship between covariant and contravariant tensor components under the new class of transformations.\nWith this more general setup, physics can allow a description where the spacetime manifold itself might be curved (and therefore cannot not admit globally defined inertial frames). On a local scale, however, spacetime is assumed to be Minkowski: in a small neighbourhood of a spacetime event, a frame which looks locally inertial can always be found. Care is needed to have a tensorial notion of derivatives in this general setting (since derivatives \\(\\partial_{\\mu}\\) depend on the geometry of the frame of reference); covariant derivatives \\(\\nabla_{\\mu}\\) are properly tensorial, and defined as the usual spacetime derivatives in each event’s local inertial frame. Formally, the covariant derivative is defined \\[\\nabla_{\\mu} C^{\\nu} = \\partial_{\\mu} C^{\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\mu \\rho} C^{\\rho},\\quad \\nabla_{\\mu} C_{\\nu} = \\partial_{\\mu} C_{\\nu} - \\Gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu \\nu} C_{\\rho}.\\] The \\(\\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\mu \\rho}\\) are called Christoffel symbols or connection coefficients, and they are not themselves tensors; they can be found as coordinate derivatives of the metric tensor.\nThe covariant derivative bears some similarity to the gauge covariant derivative for a quantum matter field coupled to the EM field, although they are fundamentally different (and cannot be easily combined, leading to some of the difficulties in describing charged matter fields in GR). In particular, covariant derivatives do not commute, \\[[\\nabla_{\\mu},\\nabla_{\\nu}]C^{\\sigma} = R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu} C^{\\rho},\\] where \\(R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu}\\) is the Riemann curvature tensor, which is a rank 4 tensor expressing the curvature of spacetime. As a form of generalized curl, it satisfies a Bianchi identity \\[\\nabla_{\\tau} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\mu\\nu} + \\nabla_{\\mu} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\nu\\tau} + \\nabla_{\\nu} R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\rho \\tau\\mu} = 0,\\] as well as several symmetries between its indices, leading to 20 independent components.\nThe contraction \\(R^{\\sigma}_{\\phantom{\\sigma}\\mu\\sigma\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) defines the symmetric Ricci tensor with 10 independent components, in turn whose contraction \\(R^{\\mu}_{\\phantom{\\mu}\\mu} \\equiv R\\) gives the curvature scalar. Einstein defined a curvature tensor \\(G^{\\mu\\nu} = R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu} R\\) which is divergence-free, and the Einstein field equations are \\[G^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T^{\\mu\\nu},\\] whose source term is the total stress-energy tensor of all energy-momentum (matter, EM fields, ...). This equation is nonlinear, and hence very difficult to solve in general.\nIn general relativity, gravity appears as a form of ‘fictitious force’ arising from choice of a non-inertial coordinate system. Other phenomena should be described in usual tensorial form, albeit with covariant derivatives; in GR, Maxwell’s equations are written \\[\\nabla_{\\mu} F_{\\nu\\rho} + \\nabla_{\\nu} F_{\\rho\\mu} + \\nabla_{\\rho} F_{\\mu\\nu} = 0, \\qquad \\nabla_{\\mu}F^{\\mu \\nu} = \\mu_0 J^{\\nu}.\\]\nGeneral Relativity can also be cast in a Lagrangian form, as originally suggested by Hilbert. The corresponding ‘Einstein-Hilbert action’ has a strikingly simple form: \\[\\mathcal{S} = \\int (C R + \\mathcal{L}) \\sqrt{-g}{\\rm d}^4 x,\\] where \\(C\\) is a constant, \\(R\\) is the curvature scalar, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is the Lagrangian density for matter and EM fields, and \\(g\\) is the determinant of the metric tensor at each point. (In special relativity, we could ignore \\(\\sqrt{-g}\\) because the determinant of the Minkowski metric is always \\(-1.\\)) The Euler-Lagrange equations, on varying the metric tensor, give the correct Einstein field equations.\n\n\nQuantum Field Theory\nQuantum field theory is a natural extension of this course: our approach to quantum matter fields did not include multiple quantum particles, which can only be described when ‘fields are quantized’. This procedure is rooted in the fact that our relativistic field equations (with mass—and hence \\(\\hbar\\)—or otherwise) are all classical PDEs, expressing equations of motion for field variables continuous over space and time.\nIn a fixed Lorentz frame, one can find wave fields oscillating at a fixed frequency \\(\\omega\\) with time dependence \\(\\cos \\omega t.\\) Quantizing the field consists of quantizing this as a ‘classical harmonic oscillator’ (even if it is a quantum wave), giving, for each frequency \\(\\omega,\\) quantized energy (frequency) eigenstates \\(\\hbar \\omega (n+\\tfrac{1}{2}),\\) with a corresponding ‘occupation number’ \\(n.\\) The ladder nature of the quantum harmonic oscillator spectrum implies going up (or down) by \\(N\\) steps requires \\(N\\) ‘quanta’ of \\(\\hbar \\omega,\\) and for the EM field, these ‘quantized field vibrations’ are photons!\nThis procedure is sometimes called ‘second quantization’: we already had one Hilbert space describing the modes of the field, and now to each Fourier frequency \\(\\omega\\), we associate an extra harmonic oscillator Hilbert space! The quantized field excitations must satisfy the correct particle statistics on exchange (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac), and thus fermion field modes can only have an occupation number of 0 or 1. The quantization of free fields is straightforward, but not necessarily informative. Interactions must also be built in, and how this complicates matters is easier perhaps to see in the ‘Lagrangian approach’ to second quantization, rather than the Hamiltonian ‘canonical field quantization’ above.\nThe ‘Lagrangian approach’ is based on the path integral approach to quantum mechanics, where quantum probability amplitudes relating initial and final states are found by the sum \\(\\sum_{\\mathrm{all\\,paths}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rm i}{\\hbar}\\mathcal{S}\\right).\\) The paths consist of all possible sequences of values, over all times, that the degrees of freedom the corresponding classical Lagrangian \\(L\\) may take, and this approach is completely dual to the usual Hamiltonian picture of Hilbert spaces, operators, etc. The classical equations of motion arise in the semiclassical limit, as the exponentials in the path sum oscillate very rapidly apart from when \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) does not change much when the path is varied, i.e. when the Euler-Lagrange equations are satisfied.\nNow, classical fields have an action too, but rather than sum over all paths, we now take a functional integral over all spacetime field configurations which satisfy our given boundary conditions on our chosen spacetime volume \\(\\Omega.\\) Once again, the classical field equations arise when the action is stationary with respect to field variations, but now, there are always small fluctuations around, which are usually interpreted as particle-antiparticle pairs appearing in the vacuum (which also enters the canonical quantization picture from the ‘zero point energy’ \\(\\hbar \\omega/2\\) for each frequency).\nFor ‘Quantum Electrodynamics’, the action is that corresponding to \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{QED}}\\) as derived in the lectures. The free Dirac term, and the EM field term, are complicated but calculable, as the Lagrangian is quadratic in those terms, so the functional integral can be treated as a generalized Gaussian. However, the interactions, involving a cubic product of \\(\\psi, \\overline{\\psi}\\) and \\(A_{\\mu},\\) cannot be evaluated analytically. Nevertheless, since the coupling constant is small—it can be taken to be the dimensionless fine structure constant \\(\\alpha = q^2/2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar c \\approx 1/137\\)—the cubic term in the Lagrangian in the exponential can be Taylor expanded within the functional integral. The resulting series (with gaussians in the free field Lagrangians) can be interpreted combinatorially via ‘Feynman diagrams’, made up of ‘interaction vertices’, each one originating from the cubic interaction term in the full QED Lagrangian.\nThis theory has many mathematical problems which physicists have learned to get around or reinterpret, and all calculations are based on evaluating perturbation series. Nevertheless, precise experiments agree extremely well with quantum electrodynamic predictions, and the theory arises directly on generalizing classical relativistic field theory.\n\n\nGauge Theories\nThe great success of QED inspired the quest to find alternative quantum field theories to describe the other two fundamental forces, the weak and strong nuclear forces, again starting with Lagrangian field theories. Given that protons and neutrons have very similar properties apart from charge, Heisenberg suggested that they were in fact two orthogonal ‘isospin’ states of some 2-spinor in the internal field space of a ‘nucleon’ particle. That is, instead of being independent Dirac particles, they are two components of an ‘isospin doublet’ \\((p,n),\\) and the corresponding Lagrangian should be invariant to \\(2\\times 2\\) unitary transformations of this 2-spinor, by analogy with the usual Lagrangian of a quantum wave being invariant to transformations of the complex phase.\nHowever, it is not immediately obvious what sorts of fields/potentials arise from such nonabelian (i.e. noncommuting) gauge transformations of multicomponent fields. Yang and Mills (Phys Rev 96 (1954) 191-5) observed that, since all \\(N \\times N\\) unitary transformations can be represented by \\(U = \\exp\\left({\\rm i} \\sum_k \\tau^k \\ell_{k}\\right),\\) that is as exponentials of sets of generators \\(\\ell_k\\) (which are hermitian \\(N \\times N\\) matrices), nonabelian Yang-Mills potentials can be defined \\(A^k_{\\mu} \\ell_{k}\\) (with the summation convention on \\(k\\)). These potential matrices couple to matter via generalizations of the gauge covariant derivative, and give rise to (nonlinear, nonabelian) ‘fields’ similar to the Faraday tensor.\nThe original attempts to describe the strong nuclear force with \\(2\\times 2\\) unitary matrices failed. However, in the 1960s, Gell-Mann showed that a generalization based on \\(3\\times 3\\) unitary transformations could describe the strong nuclear force in terms of quarks and colour interactions, and in the 1970s, Salam, Weinberg and Glashow showed that the weak force can be understood from an SU(2) \\(\\times\\) U(1) ‘broken symmetry’ from a larger invariance combined with electromagnetism, the ‘electroweak force’.\nAlthough all of these further theories require generalizations, including curved spaces, operator-valued fields or matrix-valued potentials, they are rooted firmly in the language of relativistic field theory. I hope that your knowledge from this course of relativistically covariant fields, Lorentz invariant Lagrangians, Noetherian symmetries, etc, should help you in the future in trying to understand these fundamental theories of the universe!",
